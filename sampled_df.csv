6058802,1.0,PERFECT FIT ON MY 97 TAURUS CLASSIC CAR / AND NEW PIONEER SPEAKERS
356055,1.0,Is so nice to put away a bunch of remotes and have one really nice one do their job! Easy to use after you read the manual and is great quality!
961750,1.0,...but the price is very low! Been so tired of using a firewire for my external Samsung eSata hard drive. This thing made data transfer 10x the speed (full Sata II data rate).
6460818,0.0,"HORRIBLE computer, and bad service.  Fan grinds, ports break, and poor service.

I bought one of these over a year ago.  Since then, I've returned it twice to where I bought it, because the internal fan eventually wears and becomes incredibly noisy (meaning you will hear a constant grinding sound).  The most recent (my third) had a failing usb port, which now I can't replace/exchange at the purchase location because it's over a year (although each lasted less than six months).  HP service told me that I had to send the machine to them, and they will determine whether the port failed because of a defect, or my use, and if they determine it's my use, then they will charge me $500 for a new motherboard (apparently the port is attached to the motherboard and can't be replace simply).  So they will arbitrarily decide whether I pay $500, I wonder how that will go?  I decided to not take the risk, and now, of course, the fan on this machine is grinding.

This design should be scrapped or completely revamped.  Costco stopped carrying them, likely because there were so many issues and problems."
1574527,0.0,"I OPNED THIS THING UP TO SEE WHAT WAS INSIDE. ITS A PATENTED PIECE OF OVAL FLAT ANODIZED ALUMINUM. HORRIBE. I WOULD NOT HAVE PAID $5.00 FOR THIS THING. I LEFT IT OPENED TO THE AIR, NOW IT WORKS GREAT. I PITTY THE ONES WHO PAID $130.00 FOR THIS THING."
5525950,1.0,"solid construction, what i expected."
1253974,0.0,"I ordered 2 of these cables got them sooner than expected.  installed first cable and colors wrong.  inverted blue and red one end and worked fine.
removed cable and inspected found red and blue labels inverted on one end.

Inspected the other cable and found correct.  installed and working.  not really sure how to return 1/2 order.  Will leave at one star till I get it resolved."
4724109,0.0,"this adaptor is the perfect solution for connecting Kindle Fire to TV via HDMI or other monitor that accepts HDMI
The statement above is incorrect. This cable will not fit my Kindle Fire HD 8 (6th generation) tablet. When I called Amazon ""support"" I was told that my Kindle tablet was not capable of being connected to a TV (like for streaming content from Kindle to TV).
Why then is Amazon selling such cables and making the claim it is for Kindle Fire when it does not even fit the micro usb port on the device? Also, it would have been nice to know that my Kindle will not stream via cable or otherwise to a TV."
3667418,1.0,"Sturdy, fits well and protects the tablet perfectly"
4912014,1.0,"This is the best value by far in V mount professional batteries. Nearly twice the amp hours of the competition for a fraction of the price! The build quality is top notch and having a built in D-tap for both charging and output, plus a USB charging port is simply icing on an already sweet cake!
Highly recommended!"
6513247,1.0,"Good Product, Nice Quality, Good Price, Fast Shipping explain the 4 stars  Purchased from Sat Pro"
2666063,1.0,"Superb engineering, excellent build quality, rock solid connection and a great signal transmitted!"
5270082,1.0,"My first fan had an issue with the power insert.  Basically the power insert was pushed into the fan over time by the USB cord.  This is probably an isolated issue since the reviews for this fan are very good.  I wrote a review about the fan and my experience with the power insert.  Efluky contacted me and offered to replace the fan free of charge.  I'm impressed with the company for the follow-up and have updated the review based on their customer service.  I also like the fan very much.  It barely weighs anything and has three fan settings.  The highest fan setting is perfect for one of those hot days in the office.  Overall, I'm very satisfied!"
4472609,0.0,Audio jack is super loose without any supporting structure around. Sound is awful like enteral electronics are broken. Returned on the first day.
318478,0.0,We returned this GPS since it spent more time searching for our location than it did helping us find our way.  It also had a habit of suddenly losing power and we had to start over.
3475284,1.0,Works great no problems plug and play
27917,0.0,"if you have a small camera and a few accessories, this is great- gave it to a friend who has accessories for his smart phone camera because it was not enough of a bag for me and my lenses, flash, batteries etc..."
1203621,1.0,"very nice if all your pedals input/outputs are not staggered.  MXR or Boss pedals good...  ProCo Rat, ot TubeScreamer  not so good."
5612469,1.0,"I did a lot of research and looking, on these action cameras. Didn't want to spend on a GOPRO, as this is my first action camera,  Glad I didn't !!
This camera is so amazing with the video , that i can't put it down!! Will really enjoy when weather changes, so i can take it out on my boat, and record some fishing trips!! The Wifi works effortlessly with my Iphone,and did i say the video is absolutely crisp and amazing on 1080p 60 fps. The sound is pretty amazing as well. You won't be sorry purchasing this camera, i know I'm sure not. If anything for some reason would go wrong with it, I would not hesitate to replace it with the exact same camera, without a doubt !! Slight issue with some missing  pieces of attachment accessories, but let me just say, I shot an email off to Amazon Customer Service, explaining my issue, and they responded back to me within minutes, offering options to rectify the  issue !!! They were so appologetic, and wanting to make things right, my issue was resolved in a matter of approx. 2 hours via email. I couldn't be happier with Amazon!!
As far as stars, I wish there were more, they would all be lit up !!!

Thanks again Amazon, you will have my continued business!!!"
2481277,1.0,"I bought this DVD to use it with my new Sony 55"". It does work well and the ability to use the same remote for both the TV & DVD it's a great time saver."
3550802,1.0,"Love this camera. This is the second I've bought, after my first went for a swim. Not great in low light settings, but the zoom is phenomenal, I mean just outstanding, and the macro is great. Super versatile, fun to use."
3588470,1.0,just what I needed to fit - 9' - no noise
3929451,1.0,"No problems, excellent price"
2946363,1.0,Product is excellent in all aspects. I recommend this Product.
3571851,0.0,"Look closely at the pictures. Look at the connector. Yes - it's USB type A. Google it if you don't know what that means. It's the type of USB connector that should be on the Host (your computer), not on your drive. It does come with a cable that makes it work, but if you lose that, you're stuck. In addition, they don't show the cable, but its 2x USB A (computer) to 1x USB A (drive). So, it'll take up 2 of your computer's USB slots and be an unreplaceable cable. Would not recommend."
5962411,1.0,Really pleased with this item. Quality is great. And the price in comparison to other speakers slightly larger makes it a deal
1965481,1.0,"You can't go wrong with G.Skill.  Never an issue, always works."
3497642,0.0,"This tablet keeps shutting off! We have reset it, reinstalled it, and tried to set it up on another computer and it still has had the same issue.
It worked for the first 2 months, just enough to get past the return policy limit, of course!"
1904922,1.0,"This looks very hight quality construction. Wish all cables are like this. More importantly, it works fine too. If I buy more, I definitely buy from this brand (manufacturer)."
5103545,1.0,Works fine in my drone.
304443,0.0,"Purchased some of these drives for a RAID, and half were DOA.  Seagate's drives seem to have taken a nosedive in reliability recently. This is, of course anecdotal, and may not be cause and effect, but it seems that since much of the production was shifted from Thailand and Singapore to China, the drives are not reliable.  I have been using Seagate drives for more than two decades, and have had great success until the last few years.  Maybe it's a coincidence, but the only Seagate drives I've had fail were the ones purchased in the last couple of years, and all were produced in China.  It has been more than a few, now.  Half of the examples of this model I purchased were DOA- one, for example, spun up, but was unformattable.  Drive failed the Seatools tests and reported a huge number of unrepairable bad sectors.  If you can't count on HDs to be reliable, how can you function (computer-wise, of course)?  Of course, I back up redundantly and in real-time, but who wants to go messing around having to constantly restore data?  Also, Amazon's ""Frustration-Free Packaging"" is a little on the skimpy side as far as protection goes."
5537347,0.0,"Ordered 2 sticks, 1 was doa. Got a replacement and both were doa... debating if I should try again...

Pros: the one stick that worked seemed to be pretty fast, didn't run any tests though.

Not satisfied"
4879407,0.0,"Did not work as advertised. You have to use an app that converts whatever video/music is on your phone and then it plays it over ""airplay"". This is NOT an airplay adapter. I could select it as an audio device in iOS control center, but audio still would not work. To be fair, the audio and video worked when I used the garbage app. But this is not airplay."
5962442,0.0,"Second Anker, both epic battery failure. First the premium speaker, dead after about 3 songs. I bought this, received last night, fully charged unit and listened to about 10 songs, today it's dead and is now charging again. Second Anker speaker battery issue."
3578582,1.0,Have had this since October of 2014.  Quick and easy to install.  I store all of my games and other programs on this drive and store my music and photos on my 'old' non-SSD 1TB drive.  Bought a 2nd one (250GB) for a tablet docking station and I plan to buy a 3rd for a custom PC I'm building for the wife.
5622167,1.0,"Great picture. This is the second Sony Bravia I own. Purchased a 40"" about 4 years ago and had zero problems with it. Was needing a new TV for the bedroom and saw this one was discounted (last year model). I don't watch it much, just something to set sleep timer and go to sleep to. Small remote compared to the 40"" and are interchangeable. Also have Sony Blu-Ray DVD player. It synchs with either TV by HDMI cable."
481754,1.0,"I have been using these for many years and they continue to work well and have good sound. The rubber inserts are comfortable in my ears, although I recently replaced them for cleanliness."
4475451,0.0,"Purchased 2 of these SSD's to upgrade  from 240GB to 500GB RAID0 for my Sabertooth X79 EFI 4801 but after I installed them the EFI would only show 1 SSD. So I installed them individually and both worked fine but could not get them to work as a pair no matter witch SSD port I installed them on. I thought maybe an incompatibility so I tried them in my older X58  board and they did the same thing, could see them individually but not as a pair... sending them back."
6009051,1.0,"I must admit, I'm not an expert on the My Passport Wireless Pro Portable External Hard Drive (wow, that's a long product name). The external hard drive was used by a family member on a recent international trip... and she had nothing but positive things to say! One plus is the price point, which I am told is reasonable. Another positive aspect of the product is the battery life, which lasts for approximately ten hours. However, her favorite feature was the USB slot allowing for portable charging of electronic devices. Overall, we would definitely recommend the My Passport Wireless Pro Portable External Hard Drive to others look for a one terabyte hard drive that is conveniently portable."
5496452,1.0,Remote works fine thank you
4136103,1.0,it has worked like a champ for a year with no hiccups and massive transfer of music and movies.  I have no problem recommending this.
5937486,1.0,"This was much more than I had expected.  My Fire HD 10 never felt this good before.  The case does everything it says and also provides excellent protection for the physical tablet.  Turns on and off as I open the case.  Provides drop protection, of which I have accidentally tried out a few minutes after I installed the cover.  It worked!!  And, It really looks sharp.  I should have done this long ago.  RH"
3988685,0.0,"We used it for our apartment next to the parents house that had dsl. But kept turning 'orange' instead if staying yellow light. And kept making us turn it off and on, unplug and plug again to properly work. Finally we gave up and returned this item"
6060044,0.0,"It's cheap for a reason.  It played fine through my phone, but when I played it through my computer it was full of static. I connected a Jawbone through my computer and it worked fine, so it was clearly a problem of the speaker.  I will return this speaker and spend more money for better quality."
640424,0.0,"Terrible.
I bought two from two different sellers. One from each seller. One never worked, the other one worked once. I after a few shots it overheated and stop working.
I was so disappointed, that i put them I didn't know where, and by the time I found them it was too late to ask for a refund. Terribly cheap light."
1169107,0.0,"I bought this TV after reading all of the other reviews which were admittedly mixed. I can't get a single TV station to come in no matter where I have the TV.  Our ""local"" stations are about 35 miles away and that must be too far.  I will eventually buy an antenna, to see if that might help, but that may only add to the expense and perhaps the frustration."
2204272,1.0,"Of course I had to get it in army green..

So my eee pad was dropped a few times by my kids and the bezel was severely twisted and popping out and cracked. This solved my problem of not being able to find a replacement ( the only one I could find was overseas for close to $100!)

It fits so tightly I don't need to drop more money on a replacement bezel. And it looks so cool now."
585376,0.0,"Inexpensive powered Speakers meant for listening not enjoying.  Absolutely no fidelity to the sound.  Muffled with no presence, no high end to speak of.  If you listen to audio books these would do.  Not sure what else.  Currently looking for something better for a little turntable and pre-amp set up.  If these were my only speakers they would have been dumped in the trash can a while back."
1004717,0.0,"This is not a Y splitter the red side is just power... I have no idea what it is meant to power, but it is basically useless if you plan to hook 2 computers to 1 printer"
2783041,0.0,"Terrible audio both transmit, and receive. Not heavy duty for everyday use. Save your money and get the anytone or Kenwood versions."
680160,0.0,"I went looking for a decent record player to listen to my records with and settled on the Jensen . Buying this turntable was a terrible mistake . It won't play records at all . The cheap warped plastic platter wobbles like a Pringle making it impossible to even start the stylus on the record . I scratched the heck out of two records trying to get it to work . I then removed the e-clip that holds the platter down to take a look underneath and see what it rides on thinking that maybe it could be adjusted in someway . No such luck , it's just a thin molded piece of plastic with a bushing through the center that spins on a spindle . There's no way to fix that , the platter is simply deformed . It's not worth destroying your records , buy something better ."
867779,1.0,I bought two of these and installed them into a small enclosure and they sound great. I don't really have anything to compare them against though.
6130453,1.0,Solid build. A great alternative or backup to a 410 geared head. I use it with an arca swiss adapter.
385378,0.0,I thought it was junk and returned it.
2400859,0.0,"If you haven't found out yet, this keyboard is attached to the aluminum body of the computer by approximately 100 screws, replacing this keyboard took me about 5 hours of labor (complete tear down of the computer + reassembly).
After I finished reassembling the computer, I noticed THE KEYBOARD HAD 4 KEYS (H R / 6) COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE.
Although the keyboard is defective, I am not returning it because I'm not going to invest the time to take the computer apart again."
3762470,1.0,fit perfect and works very well!! A better price than what the stores offered.
4646436,0.0,D.O.A. should have known by the price what I was getting. Did not work right out of the box. Either through USB or headphone plug. Another quality product offered through amazon.
2131572,1.0,I would highly recommend using this cable for connecting components in a tower instead of its shorter counterpart. It is much more flexible and allowed for much turning/maneuvering.

5856944,0.0,"Purchased this, worked for a day, then had the same issue of disconnecting and then a horrible clicking noise would come from it.

1130040,0.0,Bought these discs and am now after over a year finding that they do not play.  They did work when recorded but now my files are gone.  Would never buy Memorex Blue Ray discs again - have seen other reviews to this effect.  I don't write many reviews but am so upset that I had to write this one.  Wasted a lot of money on the discs and then lost the files.  And I have more of them left from a second purchase - don't know what to do with them.
4194689,0.0,Clips on adapter ring are to small and the lens hood keeps falling off. I am Truly disappointed in this product.
859606,1.0,"Coming from many PCs in my life, I have to say I couldn't be more pleased with the Macbook PRO. The LCD is sparkling clear, the keyboard is strong and quiet, the speakers are decent, clear (but a bit underpowered) and the software is great. Go check out Apples website before buying and look at the included ""iLife"" products. It is truly amazing that this software is INCLUDED with mac! Also check into student/education or other discount programs to see if you qualify. I would advise a 3 year warranty to be safe, laptops have issues more often than desktops according to most! Also, grab a bluetooth mouse, and a cover/case on the way out and youll be all set!
Enjoy the quality!"

1126284,0.0,"cheqp piece of Chinese s***. I threw it away. It was flimsy and couldn't hold my laptop, then it cracked and i used some pretty fowl language. Piece of s***. Broke the first time I used it. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!"
1779540,1.0,"Great cable instead of having to replace to the whole shure headphone for $200.  I use the shure's almost everyday for exercising and after a year, the cable was starting to short out.  Luckily Amazon had them in stock and I received them quickly as usual.  It seem almost the same quallity as the original, although part of the cord is a tiny bit smaller than the original.  The package said ""Made In China"" and I am not sure if they are Shure certified or not.  But the cable assembly works great and I will probably get another for a back up.  I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about this cable for- a $30 cable versus $200 for new headphones.  I guess some people will always see the glass as half empty instead of half full.  BUY IT and you won't be disappointed nor will your wallet."
192571,0.0,Unecessary and useless. It's a bit on the flimsy side (thiner plastic than I was expecting) and not really good for thick utility cords. I'm going to give this to someone as a gift.
1983598,1.0,Amazing for the price. Extremely bright. I bounce it off ceilings and panels for a much softer effect. The knobs stay firm and it is stable on a tripod (I don't run and gun with this much). The huge plus is the battery meter in the back. That's just something I didnt' expect in a $30 product.
5353366,0.0,Didn't work for my tablet or maybe it was just the headphones
2948948,1.0,"This cover turned out much better than I expected.  The leather looks really nice, with white stitching accentuating the black color.  It has a magnetic closure that wakes the iPad automatically when it opens.  The hand strap is a nice touch, along with the holder for business cards, credit cards, or ID.  Some reviewers mentioned a smell, but I never noticed one.  I highly recommend this cover to give your iPad Mini some classy protection."
1075984,0.0,I order this close to 2 years ago and just did not like it. It was very cheap and flimsy. I only used it about twice before giving up on it and buying something better.
5351679,1.0,The color is amazing not to fond of the pure white top of it but a case will fix that lol. It's slim and easy to use the packaging was great so it was safe on delivery and so far so good no complaints if you are looking for a laptop with basic  needs for it then this is the one for you. I will keep a update going once I have it longer but so far so good!
2008734,1.0,"I've been using this keyboard and mouse for several years now and the mouse has just developed a slight catch in the roller wheel, but has worked flawlessly up until now"

In fact, I'd probably even pay full retail for these. for this price range, I don't think you can buy better sounding ear buds. the sound is crisp, clear and deep! I have another pair of ear buds that I compared them to, and these Symphonized ear buds blew the others away! Not sure if it has anything to do with the ""wood"" construction (I assume so), but the clarity & rich sound is fantastic... highly recommended!"

4124265,0.0,"A little concerned after reading other similar replacement power supply reviews. This one works perfectly as it should, it has indicator light when charging MS Surface also has the extra USB port. It does say original so believe it. Also it is pricey but you will pay a lot more for other replacement power supply's that don't work or fail quickly. Full disclosure I did apply heat shrink tape at the weak spots on cable just as a precautionary measure.

(03/21/2017) As a follow up this replacement Ps didn't last 6 months. I replaced with another product that is still working (see review for that ps.). I repaired this one (wiring connections) several times to keep it going but alas no more."
4131903,0.0,"I tested a new unit today (hooked to a computer) and I am quite dissatisfied with it and returned it.  I trained it on a neon orange marker with good (indoors) lighting and the camera would also report parts of a dark brown desktop and parts of a white wall too.  Maybe I have a defective unit, but this was quite useless.  Also there is ZERO CUSTOMER SUPPORT (their website does not even list an email or phone for contact)."

6281993,0.0,"I bought this hoping it would work on my new Lumix G3.  It almost did.  When pressing the remote button half way it would focus (lights on both receiver and remote also turned green), but pressing the button all the did not take a picture.  Oddly enough, pressing the button on the receiver would take a picture, but would not pre-focus.  Another wired remote I bought on Amazon works flawlessly.  Returning this."
1732452,0.0,"Edited review:

1 year out, this thing is terrible.  I literally haven't used it in months, it looks and feel like an old car that's about to break down.  I have a Lenovo laptop 3 years old and it looks 5x better than this and runs much more smoothly.  It gets dirty quickly and when it does for some reason it never comes out.  Macbooks and other upper tier notebooks do not have this problem as much, HP Acer and Asus products do.  I was expecting a netbook I paid over $400 for to have a similar return in quality; it only lasted a few months.

I think the biggest problem is no proprietary software- so if you installed a Linux operating system you can never re-install or do a factory reset unless you pay over $100 for a new version.

Overall I highly, highly regret this purchase and would take back the $430 in a heartbeat or even $150 right now."

6128213,1.0,"This DVD burning isn't as cut and dried as some would like you to believe. However, just because you get a bad burn doesn't mean it is the discs. There is a whole bunch of stuff going on in your computer that can affect the burn.

I have a Dell 1.2 ghz, with a Lite-On 8x drive, running Nero 6 OEM. Pretty generic, but these Memorex 8x and now 16x discs burn just fine. In fact, I have burnt about 600-800 of these discs and have had very few fall-outs. Not enough to justify buying the ""better"" quality discs.

Now for the caveat: I did have one spate of problems, caused by a not so well behaved antivirus program. I tossed out the antivirus program and went over to Avast!(it's free, check with Microsoft). Problem solved even though I run Winamp and a logging environmental sampling program while burning discs.

We burn hundreds of discs for a hospital lecture series. They are being played on all sorts of equipment, including some pretty banged up junk. So far I have not received one complaint about the discs only suggestions about the content.

Before you spend big bucks on some ""better"" disc, pop up your task manager in XP and see if there is some runaway task that needs some discipline. Also, if you must run ""better"" discs then do a surface test in Nero. I bet the ""better"" disc will look very close to failure if the Memorex failed."

4660660,0.0,"I love the form factor of the Miccus mini jack Bluetooth receiver and use it mostly to use my earbuds untethered from my iPhone. I also love that I can use the button to pause and skip tracks. So why only one star? The performance of the Miccus is lackluster to say the least. I often walk with my phone in my pants pocket and the Miccus hanging at my neck. You would think the range of reception would be a non-issue at such a close range but I still experience frequent drop-outs. The reception is strangely unpredictable, at times dropping out only several feet away from the source, at other times letting you stray thirty feet or so and separated by a floor or wall. The power saver mode does not work at all. I listen before bed at night and wake up hours later to find the Miccus still on even though the music ended long ago. As a result, the battery life is very disappointing, lasting only a few hours of actual use before repeatedly beeping a warning and then dying out. Lastly, that constantly blinking blue light is unnecessarily annoying and especially distracting in a darkened room. I was hoping the Miccus would be the solution for me but now find myself going back to tethered earbuds for the reliability. If anyone out there has found a better wireless option than this I would sure like to know."

It is a very lightweight case, fits the iPad Air perfectly and is thin enough that it doesn't seem obtrusive, yet it feels like it will protect the iPad well....when it closes, it turns the iPad off--so the sleep function works perfectly-- and it is great if you want to watch a movie on it as the angle of the viewing stand is perfect.

It's small, I can place it anywhere, the cable is short but I can get an USB extender, that's not a big deal. It's solid, doesn't feel cheap. The ports are smooth when you connect any plug. The light stays on even when my computer is turned off, but I think this is because I'm using Windows 8.1 and it has the ""fast boot"" option turned on, so the computer is not really ""off"", it's in a ""hibernating"" like state. So if I turn this option off, the light should turn off as well.

Every couple months I revisit it to see if I can revive this $100 paper weight. So far, no success. I'm a computer programmer and work with computers every day, so this isn't just a case of not knowing how to get the software installed. I installed it, the device connects for about 5 seconds, then disconnects and unless I uninstall and reinstall the software it never connects again. And when I do that, it does the same 5 second connect then disconnect. The leappad itself is bricked, it won't play games or anything, it just shows that it needs to be connected to a computer with an exclamation mark.

Just buy a cheap Android tablet, some educational apps, and a good case and you'll have a much more flexible device and something that isn't going to suddenly stop working 20 minutes later"
5487066,0.0,"I was really looking forward to trying this out.  After all, it sounds like a great idea.

However, I tried it out today and was soooo disappointed.  Sure, the product is cheap and flimsy, but none of that matters if it worked well enough.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't deliver.  I read the instructions (and there really wasn't much) and followed it perfectly.  I plugged it into the cigarette lighter of my Honda, looked for a FM channel where there is not a station, and set the unit to the same frequency.

It worked, but there is so much background noise and hiss.  If you lay down the transmitter in the cupholder, all you get is noise.

Anyway, I'm really disappointed and can't possibly recommend this product to anyone.  The only good thing about this product is that it isn't very expensive.  Lastly, where are all these positive review coming from?"

1222017,1.0,"I ordered this Component Video Cable with Audio for my parent's new Samsung LCD TV and up-converting DVD player.  It works great and doesn't break the bank.  Don't be fooled by other silly ""monstrously"" overpriced cables, this cable is the real deal at a fair price.  I love how the audio and video are combined into one cable.  Really helps reduce the clutter.  The cable is of good construction and has good color codes.  The grey colored plugs are audio and the black color plugs are video.

I would have gotten HDMI but my parent's DVD player did not support it.  As good as this cable is, component cables were too hard to setup for my parent's.  5 color coded plugs was too much for them to deal with.  I had to come over and install it for them, not Mediabridge's fault.  On the plus side it let me check out Mediabridge's quality.

Pros:
Cheap, much cheaper than other brands with a ""monstrous"" price.
Works great and can handle signal just as good as other ""monstrously"" overpriced cables.
Good construction with gold plated ends and strong stress reliefs.
2 in 1 cable (Audio + Video) reduces cable clutter.
Good color code scheme (Grey is audio, black is component video).

Cons:
Component video can be confusing for some to setup, not Mediabridge's fault.  (5 different plugs with 2 plugs that look 'red')"

I went back and forth on that one and this one. I eventually decided on this one for a few reasons....1- the cost. I couldn't see spending $200.00 on a docking station no matter how good it sounded. 2- I really wanted one that had FM radio on it. 3- the size was perfect for where I wanted to put it. 4- it was an attractive product. 5- it had great reviews.
I received it the other day and I love it! For what I paid for it, the sound is really good. Love the remote! Easy to use. I put it in my kitchen. May never use the alarm features, but never say never. For the $$, I couldn't be any happier. And the $200 one didn't have a radio. Also I like that I can take this anywhere.

2381501,1.0,"This is a pretty excellent router for the price point, with all the features one would expect from a current gen home user class router. This would be a 5 star review (edit - it is now, see below) if not for the fact that once every day or two, my router seems to inexplicably reboot itself for no obvious reason.  I don't believe this to be an intentional feature, probably a manufacturer's defect that didn't start showing up until a month or so into my ownership of the product.  It's a little irritating when it happens in the middle of online gaming, but really it happens infrequently enough (once every 1-2 days, sometimes 3) that really it hasn't been enough of an issue to cause me to seek to get it replaced, nor has it soured me on TRENDnet products - when this one eventually dies, as all routers do someday, I'll most likely be replacing it with another TRENDnet product.

2544958,1.0,"For a small sensor camera, this is quite good. Lens extends out to 20x zoom (from 4.5 to 90mm), which makes it useful for bird-watchers who cannot carry a DSLR with a large and heavy telephoto. Wish it were a bit more wide-angle, but that would introduce distortion. Obviously, does not have the ability to have the defocused background or the sharpness/dynamic range that one would expect from a m4/3 or APS-C DSLR, but this a lot more portable. There is minimal chromatic aberration (purple fringing etc) but not objectionable. While compact, this is not as small and light as some other compact cameras, but it will fit in a large pocket. Battery life is quite good, even with flash. The use of Av, Tv, Manual modes makes this quite versatile. You can also overlay a grid over the LCD to line up the horizon and help with composition. The manual is quite extensive, and takes a while to read - it is unlikely that one would use more than a tenth of the available features. In summary, this would make a good compact camera to carry along with your DSLR, or if you are not planning to go on a trip focused on photography but need a camera to stick in your jacket pocket just in case."

Two months ago playback of USB media would freeze and none of the remote controls worked nor the manual power switch on DVD player.  I had to disconnect AC power to the DVD player to restore function.  This happens with several different SanDisk USB sticks that previously worked in this unit.  DVD's work fine, but that is not what I bought this unit for.  It has had light use and is protected by a good quality surge suppressor.  The same memory sticks work fine on my Samsung DVD player's USB port.  I would not buy this unit again.  For those planning on DVD/CD use only it will be OK.  I expect electronic equipment to last longer than 18 months.  The Sony 5.1 A/V player is over 10 years old and much more complex, yet it works great."

1. It is slow and when i say slow ( i mean REALLY SLOW )
2. It is not stable and not trustable
3. it doesn't work all the time

I used it on my Nikon D90 and Nikon D7000 to transfer photos to my ipad ... it didn't transfer all the shots and it was extremely slow and sometimes it just freeze ...

Overall , It is a waste of money ...."

They do reduce airplane engine noise to some degree, but they do virtually nothing else with any other type of noise. With the noise cancellation function off, exterior sound went through the ear covers almost unimpeded. When I was not on a plane and I turned noise cancelling on, I could not tell that there was any difference from when the function was off. I thought the batteries may have been without a charge, so I replaced them. But the result was the same.

I do realize these are some of the cheapest noise cancelling headphones available but I returned them today for a more expensive model."

I have an xbox one , a plex shield, an atv4 and a local tv box plugged in this then to big Smasung 4K TV.

Started by watching NBA - picture just was not as good as going through an AVR  blurry/out of focus /lower res maybe.
Tried the Xbox and picture was just plain bad.
Local cable tv looked normal but it is never very good.
And the Shield had issues as it is 4k and worked some of the time.

I have 2 fish tanks with filter, heater, and lights system and they are only 5 gallon each. They are not those large crazy monster fish tank set up. This item randomly turns off randomly from an hour to two. My fish could have been at risk because temperature has been really cold in my house and they need a heater in order to survive. I immediately try out this item when I received it. I plugged everything in and it worked so I left for work and came home to it being shut off. Everything was shut off and I had to turn it back on and I noticed it happen again. I contacted the seller and they asked me to record it happen. I have a 16gb iPhone and barely have enough memory to record more than 5 minutes. Is it even reasonable to ask me to sit there the whole day and wait for this non working item to shut off. I work all day and when I come home I have to make dinner and do other chores, the last thing I want to do is sit there and wait for it to somehow turn off and be able to record this item. I am very disappointed in this non working item. I did not receive a refund and basically just tossed this item in the trash cause it completely wasted my time. For those who may be looking at this item, I suggest you look at Belkin. This Holsem power strip is a piece of junk when you try to use all 12 outlets."

These are sturdy and well made.

After giving the 6 disc set a test drive, I immediately went back on line on Amazon and purchased a multi pack of their 10 disc case and found it to be of the same quality.

1213447,1.0,"There must be a reason. Yes, indeed, because these filters work great. They aren't as expensive as the super expensive filters but the coatings and clarity are fantastic. First, the coatings. I'm a news editor. So, when I'm using the camera to capture something, I don't tend to think about keeping my equipment clean or protected. I'm only concerned about capturing the shot.  So, if it is rainy, or really dusty, or really muddy, I don't deal with the grime on the camera and lenses until I am back in the office.  I've found that these particular model of filters have really fantastic coating which makes cleaning a breeze. No more cleaning, and putting the filter back on, only to discover that dust had somehow adhered back onto the filter, so I have to take it off again and start all over. Almost always I can wipe these filters down on both sides, and screw them back onto the lens filter ring without attracting more dust. The clarity is really good as well. I have had filters which had a slightly yellow cast and one that was slightly blue which drove me nuts. These filters don't add a clor cast, I don't have any distortions in the glass. These filters are slightly more expensive than say the Japanese filters, but I find it worth it to pay the higher marginal cost."

3136907,1.0,"Great camera - the perfect ""throw it in the bag"" or ""stuff it in a pocket"" camera.
Pros -
Yes, waterproof.  We have used them on vacation taking pictures of manatees, in pools, surf, etc. Truly waterproof.
The optical improvements in the WG-3 make low light performance and color much better.
Decent flash.
Much faster to focus than previous generation.
Take very good video as well.
Simple, easy to understand menus for selecting shooting options.
Decent zoom and wide angle modes
Good macro ability - surprisingly good.
Nice display on back - easy to see in broad daylight.
Cons -
Video is ""noisy"" - if you zoom you get a very distracting buzzing as the lens is moved by the cam motor.  Very annoying.
Still not the fastest focus.
Weird internal cable attachments - of course you have to open the bottom door to get to the battery, memory chip, etc.  There is a micro HDMI and charging socket.  Instead of using standard micro USB it has a weird connector - so don't lose it!  Frankly I found it more convenient to get an external battery charger with an extra battery, and just pull the memory chip and pop it into my computer.  Cable issue(s) avoided.
Relatively short battery life.  Carry spares.
So if you want a backpack, swimming, beach casual camera - this is it!  Wife and kids love theirs.  It's really kid proof, too."

2940300,0.0,"The Ipevo PadPillow Lite Stand for iPad mini/iPad 4/iPad 3/iPad 2/iPad 1 and Kindle - Dark Gray (MEPX-06IP) is a bust.  First off, my iPad and Kindle Fire would not stay under the wedge in the front and kept tipping over.  Using it on the couch with the pad on my lap worked, but only if laying flat and that is not this products intention.  Using it in bed just made me irritated because the ipad continued to tip over no matter how I arranged the pillow.

The color and stability of this product is not the issue, I think the wedge that is supposed to hold the tablet to the pillow is either too big and causes the tablet to tip over or it is not big enough to keep the tablet in place.  Whatever the case may be, I won't be using this product for anything other than a lapdesk, maybe.  I know I definitely don't want to fight it when I am trying to read in bed.

4359737,0.0,"I bought this case on another website. Be aware that some of the listed items require you to lose some other features. ie, top/front mount AIO units. My main issue was the PSU mounting(bottom). I had two different PSU's and was only able to get ONE screw to match. I guess that is why they have a strap in there for the PSU.

I contacted Rosewill and voiced my concerns. Their response was that they would pass my info along. I replied that wasn't the response I was expecting. Next email from Rosewill, we can't refund your purchase. I NEVER ASKED FOR A REFUND.

They(Rosewill) responded to my review on the other site, meaning I can no longer edit my review.

I tried two different builds in this case...and there is NO WAY this case is worth the asking price. As I told Rosewill, I've had $40.00 case that were laid out, made better than this.

As for mounting a AIO(240mm), it fit fine in the front. In the top, the second fan is 40-50% covered by the DVD burner.

Overall....this is one of the worst cases I've ever owned in over 20+ years. I will not be looking at Rosewill in the future for cases, that's for sure."

But my BIGGEST complaint was that 2 months into having it, the shutter would not open consistently.  I sent it to Nikon to have them do the warranty work and got it back.  Tried it out, and it seemed fixed.  Took it on my next vacation.  Again, the shutter wouldn't open.  At that point I got a Canon Powershot SX260.  It far exceeds this camera, quality and reliability.  Let them work out the bugs in this camera.

Figured I'd buy just one as a back up, see if it worked well - if it did then I would consider purchasing a second one. Nope, I won't be purchasing the second one. Battery arrived on June 1, I finally got out this past Sunday June 11 to grab some photos, after approximately 65 CR2 (RAW) photos in about 30 minutes, the battery level for this showed 18% - extremely fast lost of battery life in a very short period of time compared to my other older Canon battery that has 2 cells life on it.

After a full charge, I took some shots last night June 12 - this time in JPG format. 22 photos in about 5, 6 minutes and the battery level already dropped to 90%. For me personally, the battery may be ok - at best - as a last resort emergency back up. You get what you pay for I realize that. Sure the price is tempting, it's far cheaper compared to the OEM Canon LP-E6 that retails for about $65. The problem is, in my opinion, that's what the STK battery is, cheap."

5562188,0.0,"I'd purchased a similar screen protector for my iPhone (different brand)... But I assumed this would work as well - thought it was a bit pricey... If it worked as well as the iPhone protector I use, it would have been worth it...

The main issues I've encountered are as follows:

All 4 edges pulled away from the iPad when I placed a protective shell case on - the edges of the case are almost flush with the iPad face, so it should have worked fine - not really the fault of either manufacturer, as these items weren't made to fit together... Would have just been nice if that had worked out...

So the above I can live with... Since the lifted edges don't bleed into the viewing/interactive area - bezel only... Ugly, but still usable... EXCEPT! ...that it's not... The device (which is a brand new iPad mini 4) is constantly registering multiple key presses when I haven't... Lots of back-spacing... And on apps where a function requires a tap-hold... This screen protector prevents the capacitive sensors from sensing that action...

I'm not sure if this sort of item can be returned (because of the nature of it (not re-usable))... And it's not technically broken - it just doesn't work as promised...  If I had to order again, I simply wouldn't... Frustrating."

If one pauses play and turns the machine off it does not return to where you left off.  In contrast our old Sony can pause a DVD, you can power down, play another DVD and power down and then load the DVD that you paused and it will remember where.

820101,0.0,"These speakers sound and look nice, but they have two very annoying problems. The first issue, which I've noticed from first use, is they are very susceptible to cell phone interference. Anytime my iPhone connects to the network (which is often), the speakers make a loud buzzing noise. Very annoying.

The second issue, which has gotten progressively worse, is that the volume control knob has a mind of its own. As others mention in the reviews, you turn it up and the volume goes down. You just touch it and the volume goes up. Now the volume is going up and down without me even touching the knob. I've contacted Creative customer support, we'll see what they say."

With the legs fully extended, the tripod wobbles without even attaching a camera.  The weight capacity is rated at 17lbs which is a total farce.  The legs, especially when fully extended, are about as thick as a breadstick lol.  This is in no way worth the price tag.  It's a shame because it's such a cool little unit.  The colors, carrying bag, and ball head are all awesome.  Especially the ball head, it really is fantastic.  But if you can't use the legs, what's the point?  If you're in the market for a tripod, stay clear of this and seriously look into the cheap $20 Ravelli's.  I kid you not, it's 10 times more stable, lighter, a tad longer (because it folds up standard), and about $170 cheaper."

Not even going to bother with sending this back since it was only a couple of bucks. Just proves...you get what you pay for.

3006728,0.0,"The title pretty much says it all. I have tried two different brands of these splitters and neither of them is capable of transferring  5.1 input sound sources to any of the outputs--there is only stereo sound at the outputs. My receiver/amp displays the input sound data format and I when I plugged it directly to a 5.1 input source it shows up as a 5.1 sound input. Then when I insert the splitter/amp and use any of the outputs as inputs to my rec/amp the sound signal into the rec/amp is a 2.0 stereo signal. This means the center channel and rear channel sound information is lost and all you hear is stereo. The sound level is also attenuated to about 65% of a direct input from a 5.1 source. If you do not care about being able to hear anything but the front right and front left sound, then this product will provide a good picture with stereo sound.

1617615,0.0,"So after doing some research in to media players, I bought this one for a couple of reasons;

1. it had the wifi capability, which came along with an extra wifi adapter that you can purchase
2. you could buy a portable hard drive and it could be inserted in to the media player

After receiving the media player which was shipped separately from the wifi adapter and the hard drive, I later received the ""recommended"" hard drive. The recommended hard drive I received didn't fit in to or slot in to the media player and when I contacted Amazon to query this, they didn't have an answer. Amazon staff need MORE product training, notwithstanding their listing for this item and the recommended accessories is MISLEADING.

After all this I am still waiting for the wifi adapter, which was ""In Stock"" at the time of placing an order for all 3 items, but now has been cancelled by Amazon because its no longer available. I've tried buying it from third party sellers and same thing, was ""In Stock"" when I ordered it but then I waited weeks with no product, update or response.
Amazon needs to be more accurate when telling customers something is ""In Stock"" when it clearly is not.

So now I am stuck with a media plater with a hard drive that doesn't fit in to it, and NO wifi capabilities.
This was a BAD BUY!"
1589560,0.0,"There is a big flaw in this product: the setup.

The product is basically impossible to setup if you don't have a Windows computer with a wireless card.

The web interface for setup has tabs to choose your WiFi network or select your TCP/IP config (DHCP or Static), but they're not on the same tab. Furthermore, the tabs require you to 'save & restart' and there is no 'save' option.

This means you can either change your wireless settings, or switch to DHCP (it comes pre-setup with a static IP, subnet mask and router) but you can't do both.

The issue here is that if I have a wireless network running DHCP on a different range of IP's that the 192.168.0.x subnet the device comes with it's impossible to setup as I can only join it to the network OR change the IP config. If I change just the IP config, then it's ad-hoc network for setup no longer functions.

Zero stars. I'm going to use an ethernet print server instead."

2478505,1.0,"5/31/2012 update: It is now 9 days since I updated the USB driver in Windows 7.  The Uspeed hub has been fine, just sitting there doing its job.  No drama anymore.  I have to confess that I would not have bothered with the driver update and test if it weren't for Uspeed's support and direct contact.  If they're watching (and they probably are) the updated driver is version 1.0.0.112 and I downloaded it directly from Etron Technology (who made my computer's USB chip).  Anyways, thanks to the support and resultant extinguishing of drama, this hub is upgraded to 5 stars.

5/22/2012 update: Uspeed has been in contact and is working with me to see what the problem might be.  They are impressively proactive.  My USB 3.0 drivers (under 64 bit windows 7) were pretty old (circa 2010) and there have been complaints about old drivers.  So, the Uspeed hub is back in service with the new drivers.  Will see if it is reliable.  +2 stars for Uspeed caring about their customer (me).  Will update based on the test results.

When it works, it's great.  Then, suddenly, it's gone.  An  so are any drives plugged into it.  On the bright side, I used a USB 3 extender cable so the hub could sit on my desktop.  Now I plug my drives into the end of the extender.  Much handier.  It never drops the connection either.

Something I noticed is that the underside of the hub got hotter than seemed reasonable.

Overall, if you are shooting outdoors in the day time, this lens will work just fine.  It defiantly does not work for low light.

They have good range, I was able to put my phone down and utilize several stations without any interference or interruption to the device. The verbal prompts that indicate power on/off and connected are a nice feature, I like knowing that it's working and confirmation that it is off. The sound quality was acceptable to me, but I'm not an audiophile, so as long as I can hear my music, I'm good.

Edit:
I wanted to love these, and originally I did. However, I've now gone through two pairs with the second one not lasting nearly as long as the first. I use these only in the gym and liked their fit and range but I don't think they handle the sweat well. Both sets showed severe corrosion when I peeked inside. If you don't plan on sweating when you use these they may be a good buy, but if you do, I'd go with something else."

6227536,0.0,"I originally bought this for a Mac. Although the installation was relatively smooth, it was nothing more but a headache.

I had this setup no more than 2ft away from my wireless router, but I was only able to get 80% signal strength (you would think it would reach well into higher 90's or even 100% due to close proximity).  But when I took my Mac to a second floor of my house, the signal strength was around 25% to 40% at best.

After reading the box carefully, it states if you want a stronger signal..detach the default antenna and upgrade (meaning buy another antenna) for longer range.

The product clearly states 150Mbps speeds, but this is further from the truth.  Calling tech support was a joke!!! They tell you to change the channel speed on your router, but to no avail.

Overall, this was purchased no more than two weeks ago and was a failure. Don't waste your money if you plan to utilize this product on a different floor within your home. However, if you plan to have it within the same floor, hopefully this will work out for you."

1474873,1.0,"I was getting ready for some serious traveling with my 3-year old RX350, and wanted to be able to hear my music without having to shuffle CDs.  Trouble is that the (optional) iPod/iPhone dock is in the glove box, and I didn't want to have to park my normal size iPod there.  Beside that, the older RX350's (like mine) have a less capable BlueTooth function set and can't be used to interface with the bigger, full function iPods and smart phones.  But the price and size of this iPod Nano took care of all of that easily.

So this nice little Nano stays in the glove box except when I'm updating it's music library.  And it was great being able to listen to what I wanted to as I drove across country, and without having to pay fees for satellite radio.  The Nano is able to display what's playing and allows navigation of it's library and playlists from the car's audio system controls, although this IS a little tricky.  I know that this does work a lot better on the newer model RX350s.  But the sound was flawless playing through my car's sound system.  And of course, the car's dock keeps the Nano charged.

Bottom line:  This was a wonderful solution to getting my iTunes into my older Lexus."

Returning these and will search elsewhere. Never got to test their performance or sound claims but will probably look towards Noctua or other brands.

These look nice, and a twin pack is a lot cheaper than some of the single fans other places sell... but those other places might sell you working fans for the price.

Update successful. I should have put it in the box then and there and taken it back, but instead I popped in a Blu ray.

The picture quality was amazing. Unfortunately it kept refusing any remote commands on menus. I would wait 30-45 seconds. No response, I would retry at multiple angles, thinking I'm out of range. Then the menu would suddenly respond to all dozen or so remote presses at once, like something in the unit just has to catch up before it could do what I asked.

The problem is, ACER will not provide ANY customer support for any device which is ""refurbished""  The first thing customer service does is check the SN.

They fob you off to the refurbishment company and tell you any service or support is their problem.  The various Factory Authrized"" refurb companies of course actually have no customer service operations, so you are an orphan.

I have to say, I'm impressed with its sound quality!  This is one little but powerful speaker.  ..Next, I wanted to see just how waterproof it really is, so I took let it keep playing while I put it under the shower's stream!  I left it there for 2 songs (approximately 5-6 minutes), and it didn't miss a beat.
Another big selling-point of this speaker is, you're able to use it as a charger for your iPhone!  I don't know about other types of phones (since I only an iPhone).  But, this is definitely a unique feature for a bluetooth speaker!
Also, I can say that my iPhone5S easily linked up to the speaker's bluetooth signal.  To top it off, I personally think that this speaker looks cool and has a nice shape/design to it!
So, now I can confidently say that I'm highly impressed with this speaker, and would recommend it to others. :)"

325528,0.0,"I bought the Nikon CoolPix 5600 several months ago to replace a Cannon that had been turning my pictures funny colors.  I bought the Nikon because I needed a camera right away and wanted to spend about $200 and the Nikon seemed to fit the bill. I have to say I liked the Canon better. I didn't buy the camera on Amazon but instead bought it at a local camera shop.  What the salesman promised and what the camera delivers are two different things.  The Nikon is smaller and fits into my pocket book, backpack, or even my pocket really well but the picture quality is not what I would expect from a 5.1 megapixel camera.  Also the shutter speed on this thing is ridiculous.  If you want to take several pictures in a row using the flash forget it because it takes about 30 seconds to recharge after it uses the flash.  Shutter speed without the flash is several seconds also.  I have also found that the ""exposure settings"" don't work very well.  Every time I use them the pictures come out discolored, blurry or something else so its not worth using them.  The battery life is supposed to be really good too but I have found that I go through batteries like crazy so rechargeable batteries are a must with this camera.  The one thing that I do like about this camera is the video.  For a camera it takes quality videos with sound, which is a nice addition.  Over all I have to say that I am not impressed with the Nikon"

3804062,1.0,"Ordered case Dec 4, arrived Dec 6. Put on Mac Air right away. Snapped on with a little effort, pinching onto laptop. The case certainly isn't leather, but feels almost like the material on the steering wheel on my car (thats the best way I can explain it). Thats a good thing, by the way. I didn't expect real leather as other did, as Kuzy advertises it as ""Leatherette."" I like the look as well; doesn't feel cheap to me but formidable. I think it will protect the Mac for the most part, barring any 6 foot drops. The color I got (Aqua Blue) is sharp and looks nice with the Kuzy white keyboard cover I ordered with it. I would definitely buy again, and will probably get another color to reflect my mood. $29, plus free shipping isn't bad for what you get. Also, my Mac Air 13"" seemed to have a loose hinge before the case cover but I do notice that is adds a little weight to the screen. I'll update if it causes me any problems in the future. If you're looking for a smart looking case, get this one ... you won't be disappointed at this price. Good luck !"

586442,1.0,"I bought this as part of the lighting deal they had about a week back. I wanted something cheap that could stand going out and having fun. I had a Kodak 6.1MP that was fine but it lacked the image stabilization I needed (If you breathed you would lose the picture). I got my camera.... and it kicks the arse of my Kodak (even though at retail time it was about $200 more...go figure...).
For one, my Kodak had 3X optical zoom then another digital zoom. This camera can do the same thing, but the picture is crystal clear in digital, kind of rare. The colors, esp. on ""Vivid"" are wonderful.
The only downside is the controls aren't what I'm used to, but that's only because I am coming off the Kodak. It's actually a really snappy camera that doesn't have much in the way of time delay and really does know what's going on as you take your picture. The high angle, back light compensation, as well as preset situations that make more sense than some of the ones on my easyshare,  helped me to make the decision to pass my old camera on and keep this one for everything, not just the quick fun going out moments.
You will love this camera. It's not the Rebel or a Nikon, but for everyday use that you can throw in a bag and go, I couldn't ask for more. Don't think the quality relates to the price: It's not just a good value, it's a GREAT value."

I wanted to take a continuous time lapse video while on a several hour kayak/brewery event.  Gives a unique (good or bad depending on what you want) view.  You will see you arms and paddle in the video.

When walking around between breweries, the harness worked great and was very stable, as long as you don't mind people asking you why you have a GoPro strapped to your chest!

The harness mount has a clip that allows you to remove the camera from the chest harness.  Once I realized the rental kayak already had a matching base already screwed into it, I removed the camera and attached it directly to the front of the kayak for a different perspective.

Overall, a nice product.  Comfortable enough to wear (Im a big guy).  Works great because it is attached to your chest, which does not rotate as you turn your head."

I use external drives a lot in my job as a broadcasting teacher.  I have 11 LaCie 250gb drives which have given me few problems.  I subscribe to a broadcasting teacher listserv, though, where people have complained about the 500 gb LaCie drives sparking, smoking, and dying on them.

No, no, no.  Because a little bubble forms around the tiny piece of dust, and no matter what you do, you cannot get rid of it.

I've had these for almost six months now.  I had to drop my review from four stars to one.  I cannot get the earbuds to stay in my ears, for one thing.  But the thing that makes these headphones almost unusable for me is the tendency for them to cause an echo on phone calls.  I use my cell phone regularly for conference calls for work, and they almost always cause an echo on the line.  I don't hear an echo on my end, but all the other users on the call hear an echo.  When I remove the headphones and hold the phone up to my ear, the problem is resolved (every. single. time.) which is how I know it's due to these headphones and not something else.  So I'm in the market for a new set of headphones for my iPhone again.  :("

The stock 1.8"" hard disk that came in said mini-laptop could only sustain 19MB/sec reads or writes, this Extreme IV card was able to sustain over 40MB/Sec reads and writes, it performed more than twice as fast as the stock hard disk, not to mention its seek times were almost immediate.

After I quit using this in the mini laptop I played around with it in an older Canon DSLR (12mp) that my fiancee was no longer using, and this card performed much faster than the camera could even hope to write to it, bust mode, raw mode, this thing held its own.  If you are a pro-sumer to pro level photographer this card would be the one to use if you need FAST response from your camera.

The speeds were somewhere between 1%-45% of the ISP speeds. Therefore, from my previous knowledge of dealing with router settings, I tried changing bandwidth and beacon levels that increased the throughput to ~45%.
To make it even worse, the connection started dropping the second day but it reconnected after a short interval.
With a 120 Mbps internet, it was hard to get webpages to load even when access from the latest browser builds.
This router has a major technical flaw and it's falsely advertised to give 1900 Mbps speeds. I only own one 5 GHz wireless ac device and all the other devices are 2.4 GHz wireless N devices. I only tested with the wireless N devices because I have a bunch of them.
The speeds promised for wireless N devices were 600 MBps at 2.4 GHz. The download speeds were terribly low as stated earlier.

Of course, I am sure they (Acer) will not honor my unhappiness with an RMA. It is still under warranty as I purchased it Feb 20 and I have 90 days for software issues. This is definitely one of those. Anyway, if you are a fan of public library MP3 audio books, forget it!!"

4838879,0.0,"When a device has 5 times as many 1 star reviews as it does 5 star reviews...well, that should tell you something.  I'll try to inject a bit of humor in this review....

Pro: great battery life....which means it can reset itself many times before needing to be recharged.
Pro: inexpensive, if it worked.  VERY expensive for a device that doesn't work most of the time

Con: only works about half the time, difficult app, lousy support.

Really wanted this to be a great device with a great startup company.

If you really want to try one of these, in spite of all the lousy reviews, order it from AMAZON so you can get your money back when it doesn't work.  I ordered my two from Pivotal and am basically stuck with them. Maybe give them to the grandkids to play with."

4023983,0.0,"I purchased this kit, charged the batteries as instructed, and only one battery would fit into my WB350F Samsung camera. The other battery was too long, so the retainer clip in the camera would not rotate over the battery. Upon inspection I could see that the end cap on the battery was loose, and bowed out. I trimmed a section of the tag, and trimmed off a bit of the battery end, and after the third trimming the battery fit and was retained. Unfortunately, the batteries only last 3 days. ( My use during this period was minimal. I take on the order of 10 photos per day, and transfer a few of them to my phone.) So, I placed the second battery into my camera, and it fit perfectly. Unfortunately, the battery only lasted a couple days.
FYI, my original Samsung Battery that came with the camera lasts many weeks, and is rated lower than the two in this kit.

But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????

Reviewing shots is instantaneous, and download to your computer is lightning fast.

I shoot quite a lot, and in my experience before buying the Lexar, you get a shot that just won't read properly off of the card every 1000 shots or so on average.  Not so with the Lexar, been using it about 7 months, probably 8000+ shots and no errors whatsoever.

INterestingly, I am running both on a dual monitor card and the differences in clarity owing to the contract ratio are amazing. (I am cheating a bit because the old on is running off analog and this one has the DVI interface.)

I love the fact that it has a 4 port USB hub on the monitor, as that helps me from having to fumble behind the desktop.

Excellent reproduction of bright and dark colors. Love the fact that it can be rotated, but haven't really used the feature much.

Cons:

- Not really a fault of the monitor, but several applications cant really take advantage of the wide aspect ratio hence its a waste of white space at times.

These were to be a replacement for the Altec Lansing Octave speakers that I purchased and sounded terrible (surprising considering I have 2 other sets of Altec speakers that sound great).  We got these hooked up and they were also defective out of the box.  We called tech support and they confirmed the speakers were defective and wanted us to pay to ship them in for repair.  I said no thanks and returned them to Amazon and replaced these with a set of Philips CSS2123/F7 2.1 Soundbar with Subwoofer speakers locally.

Great 8"" tablet -  got it working after charging for 6 hours.  As I already have aniPad, iPhone and an android phone, it was fairly easy to set-up.  As other reviewers have commented, just cannot believe the value for $99.  (Frankly they are underpricing this by good $25.)  All the basic functions of a quality tablet work well - wifi, processor speed, resolution and brightness, screen touch sensitivity, gyroscope for rotation, lite weight, google map, email, kitkat, so forth.  Can only say the unit I received functioned well (and will see how long it will last), though some reviews said had problems out of the box.  For the price, need an 8* tablet? this is it.

Now with a week on this tablet I can say it is a $100 tablet.  Compared to my iPad 2 and iPhone 6, the processor is much slower.  Loading takes 3-5 times longer and scrolling is not as smooth.  There are few bugs here or there that could be usually fixed by rebooting.  But it is much cheaper and for the price it is good for basic use.  The screen scratches easily and so I got a cheap screen protector (for Samsung 8"" tab 3) which is not exact fit but works."

The sticky tabs are supposed to help you position the screen protector, which they do, but while the one on the backing you discard peels off easily, the one on the protector itself is on there like supeglue, so ruins the protector trying to remove it. I suspect they had some new workers at the Chinese factory that day :-)

These screens measure just over 2&38"" wide and 1&13/16th"" tall, so are a tad small for most true 3"" LCDs.  But that's a moot point since you can't really use the screens with the bad tab adhesive."

I reinstalled the app, restarted the device, and then just gave up. Real bummer. The website said it is not their fault it is due to static...so yea. Apparently you are at fault if their device fails because you decided to wear a long sleeve shirt or walk on carpet.

4883705,0.0,"This product works good for me at first but then I found out that it has a fatal flaw.
The hub has 3 usb 3.0 ports and 4 usb 2.0. ports.  The 3 usb 3.0 ports seems to be paired together.  When you try to use Windows safety eject on PC, I found out you have to eject all 3 USB 3.0 ports at once.  So say if you have a thumb drive, 2.5 hard drive and a mouse, if you try to eject the thumb drive all 3 will be disconnected.  Another thing is that once ejected there is no way to plug it back and have the ports register until you restart the computer.  I have tried to disconnect/reconnect usb cable from hub to pc but it won't work.  Only a restart of the PC will get the 3 USB 3.0 ports to work again.  Oddly enough it doesn't affect the USB 2.0 ports at all.  All those ports behave normally.

I would advise against purchasing this XTG Home Power Station Hub."

This bowl solved the problem!  It took a little getting used to for her - she spent the first week glaring at me between bites as if to say ""What have you done to me?  I hate you!""  but she got used to it, and now dinnertime is a more leisurely process, chewing and swallowing each bite.  She's got to be better off for it.

My computer fits perfectly in the sleeve, keyboard included, for a snug fit that keeps the computer safe. The magnetic flap holds the case closed and is easy to open with one hand and and slide out the computer while holding the case with the other. Great for classes or anywhere you might want to whip your tablet out and take notes. The inside is soft, so if I leave the protective keyboard at home, I don't worry about the screen at all.

The pen holder has still stayed together and firm, with the elastic not coming loose or snapping. It comes with a pocket under the case flap, but separate from the surface pocket; I haven't use it, but looks great for business cards, or the possibility the you just want to bring your Surface, an ID, and maybe a credit card or cash somewhere. It lets you be minimal!  The back has an open flap for inserting a few sheets of paper as needed.

She never called, even after she sent me an email saying she set a reminder on her calendar to call me, and the next agent i talked to said he saw the note as well on this, but yeah, nothing from her.

I am not saying this tablet is a piece of crap, I'm just saying do not order it from AMAZON WAREHOUSE DEALS, they got a batch of them that are all missing these particular parts, so save yourself a headache and order from someone else.

1287113,0.0,"This was as close as I could come to a dock that would hold the iPhone in my field of view while driving (by strapping it to an old dash mount and using an extension cord). It is only a holder with two plugs and a transmitter. The bottom plug only charges and a headphone type plug carries the i tunes and phone output to the FM transmitter.  That part works but is cumbersome to attach and detach when taking the phone in and out. What is really annoying is the FM interference when I listen to a somewhat weak station. The interference comes and goes depending on the local station signal strength. If I turn it off with a switch I installed in line (the device has no off switch) the interference goes away and so does the charging feature. It also does not stop iTunes playback when the power goes off, and sometimes you have to unplug and replug the top patch cable for the FM transmitter to restart.

The drivers sound excellent with no static. Got these for less than $27 and have to say they are definitely worth more than 5x that after comparing to a friend's pair of Beats. If the phrase deep bass scares you, you may want to go with the Bluedio A (Air) headphones, they have slightly less bass and no SD card option but are super flexible and come with a nice case easily worth $15 itself. I used them to DJ a boat party and have to say they were great for cueing up tracks in a loud environment!

This model is a little more pricey, but I figured that I would spend a few more dollars to hold a $600 plus device that I own more safely. It just made sense to me.

As for the fit and finish of the unit, I am impressed. The clamp can fit just about any stand tubing you can throw at it and secures the holder snugly in place with no slop in the  The holder portion fits the iPad Air 2 perfectly.

It uses (yet another) nonstandard USB device end, requiring me to now buy a USB hub, which will add 50-150% of the cost of the device. The nonstandard cable is only a couple of inches long, so if you don't have a free USB port easily accessible, charging and maintaining the device will be difficult. With the low memory capacity (4GG), the target material should be podcasts or short interest popular music. But the file structure makes it difficult to add or delete files.

2886456,0.0,"BEWARE!!!! I purchased these for my husband last year and they have just not lived up to the hype. Battery life was about 4 hours of use while watching television (football) at first and has since dropped to under 2 hours. The sound quality was not very good--tinny at best.
 We found out this week why when we called LG to see if we could get warranty since the battery is pretty much useless now--the ones that were shipped to us are counterfeit. BEWARE!!!!

What I did NOT know then and do now is what to look for.  First, the box needs to have the LG holo sticker on it. The one hubby's were shipped in did not. The headphones themselves have the LG logo on the right side where the wire connects to the unit--the knockoff does not, it has some type of sticker that we can't read. The power switch is backwards -- on the real sets, you slide the switch ""out"" towards the earbud to turn it off, ""in"" to power on. The knockoff is exactly the opposite. There are other minor differences, but the bottom line is if you are going to purchase these -- go to a retail store and buy it from them--and check the box for the LG holo sticker.

That this was sold and shipped by Amazon is disturbing at best and I'm pretty upset at this point. We spent 70.00 that was money down the drain. My fault we did not catch this sooner, Amazon's for selling a counterfeit product to begin with."

If signal source or transmitter is turned off, speakers emit loud white-noise.

I'm running Linux Mint 18.3 with a newer kernel, and it doesn't work.  The company should update drivers for their equipment to reflect the latest platforms, and they don't.  Second, while it does work with Windows10 (I have a dual boot set up on this hard drive, so can at least use with Win10), I am now getting a ""TWCU"" error every time I log into Windows, which is discussed extensively at a microsoft forum for years - why hasn't TP-Link fixed this?

It had nicer mounting hardware, and most likely a better lens, because the color and clarity is a little better.  But for the price, this is a GREAT camera and a great value!  Also, this camera was a lot easier for me to configure (on a Mac), because when I called Swann for the other cameras, I watched them configure my other two cameras, by allowing the technician to have control of my computer.  So between that and trying to read Swann's manual (much better than the Wansview manual), I became familiar with ""port forwarding,"" which is the most complicated part.

Following the instructions that are included in these reviews, you should be able to configure this camera to meet your needs.  I did not need to try to use Wansview support, but their support web pages helped me to learn that this camera has FOCUS.

The sound quality is also pretty good. If you're looking for deep, deep bass, I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it does thump decently. Especially when you crank it up. Speaking of cranking it up, the people that left the reviews about how this speaker doesn't get very loud were lying or deaf. This speaker gets loud enough that I was playing music in the kitchen and my 4 year old in the next room covered up his ears because it was too loud for him and he even had the TV going.

This speaker was also well packaged and came with a micro USB cable and an auxillary cable. I have not used the auxillary cable yet though because I've only connected it through Bluetooth.

3278337,1.0,"So I was looking for a small inexpensive Bluetooth speaker that I could pair with my iPod touch 5th gen. And listen to my music without always having the restraint of headphones. I love to sit outside and listen to music when the weather is nice. I hadn't ever heard of HMDX or Jam until I saw these at my local best buy. I bought just one originally, but decided to go back a few days later and get a second one and pair them because so many of the reviews I saw were saying it was really worth it to do that. I couldn't agree more. I thought that one by itself sounded quite good, especially considering the size and price, but the stereo sound you get with two of them paired is a lot better and, in my opinion, worth the extra money for a second speaker. I love my two Jam Plus speakers and have thoroughly enjoyed listening to them outside and in my bedroom. The bass isn't great, but for the price and portability, it is good enough. The sound is very clear, however, and doesn't distort at high volumes. They are loud for their size too. Two of them paired fill my bedroom easily with my iPod a little below half volume and the speakers at max volume, and I have no problem hearing them anywhere on the patio when I'm outside. If you are looking for a small, inexpensive Bluetooth speaker, the Jam Plus from HMDX is a great choice. And kudos to HMDX and Jam Audio for including the pairing for stereo sound option."

563466,0.0,"If you're thinking of getting one of these to use on the trail, forget it.  The topo maps that come with it are so poor in detail as to be useless unless you just want a walk in a city.  No rivers, lakes or major topo features.  A check with Magellan's update calendar indicates nothing scheduled for the Crossover in the near future (not needed because it's new).  Email requests for info on ANY compatible maps go unanswered.  I sent mine back and will go with a Garmin."
5257374,1.0,"We have a Dell Precision M4600.  This laptop replacement battery fit perfectly.  It didn't hang out of the back like some other ""off brand"" batteries.  We love that it has a good price, currently.  Most other batteries cost more than this one.  When we received it, it already came with a 75% charge.  We had been looking for a good replacement battery for a while.  It seems all the Dell brand laptops we have had have a power supply cable that if you look at it wrong, it wiggles out.  A replacement battery is a must, especially for those times when you are working on something important and haven't saved your changes in a while.

I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest review."

2520927,1.0,Love it.  Works well.
1521523,0.0,"The device worked okay with few weaknesses of noise and antenna reception signal strength, and poor quality basic remote.
For the price I would pay after getting the mailin rebate, that was supposed to be OK.
But I am planning to return it as the manufacturer did not mail me the rebate yet. I am not able to check the status of the rebate also on their rebates website.
I do not recommend any product from Diamond if they can not be trusted to send rebates."
4953046,0.0,"Terrible investment. Tripod works ok, but is flimsy, but the remote didn't work at all. I troubleshooted it, and everything. I am not impressed with this bundle and wish I'd chosed a different one. Will not be buying again. :("

5536996,0.0,"This case feels flimsy in my hands. Additionally, the stand in the back is much too stiff to hold up the case while reading. The most annoying part is that anytime you close the case, when you reopen it, there will be vertical lines from the top of the screen to the bottom from the folds creases in the faux leather. Definitely not a keeper for me."
1390283,0.0,Nothing but mere regrets to have bought it. There cant be a DeadSlower connection than what this linkstick can give.  I checked on another adapter and it was ok. I did this to verify if there is a prob with my router. It stopped working now. Absolute trash of an adapter.

Now, they've just stopped focusing. I *might* use these things for a few minutes every 3-4 weeks. Maybe. I'm pretty disappointed. I won't by a Bushnell product again. And I wouldn't recommend them to anyone either."

B & D Seamless and many others should really consider dropping Adorama as a retailer, Adorama does not do a good job at representing most of the manufactures they carry."

3182061,1.0,I wasn't expecting such a high-quality product for the price I paid.  I got the 25' length...it works flawlessly.  The quality is definitely there...the braided cover protects it and gives it a super quality look and feel.  Will buy Twisted Veins again for sure.
3128622,1.0,Works as advertised. Used with CF to SD card adapter to replace the hard drive in my 4th Generation iPod click-wheel. Works well.

4454350,0.0,"Unfortunately this only works sporadically. It drags across the screen and feels like it is scratching it. It doesn't flow smoothly, physically. It also doesn't always recognize it on the screen. I waited 1 day too long to return. Very disappointed. I purchased as a birthday gift and had it too long."
4849536,0.0,If you're willing to lose all the bass sound then go for it. It is made from cheap materials. It's just what you get for such price. Very disappointed.
5793190,0.0,"Bought 2 of them, each lasted about a month before breaking. I do not recommend throwing your money away on this product."
5227497,1.0,"This turntable is great for what it is:  a simple way to play vinyl through your Bluetooth devices.  The audio quality is not great -- this is not a dream device for an audiophile.  Rather, this player is a convenient wireless device that is splendid for its simplicity.  Hookup to your Bluetooth device is easy and quick.  The player can handle multiple vinyl playing speeds and sizes.  The device looks great -- in fact, the styling looks like it belongs to a higer end home turntable. Sound is not bad, but I can easily tell a difference between this turntable and my old school analog turntable that is connected to a standard receiver.  As stated, you will be happy with this device if you are willing to accept that it doesn't perform like an upscale audio device.  Remember, this unit is priced very affordably.  Enjoy it for the easy way it connects to your Bluetooth devices."

3599291,1.0,This protector works great. Not a single scratch as of yet and the visibility through the protector is great. Now I am not nearly as scared of dropping my device.
2450520,0.0,"After reading other customer reviews about this product I decided to try one of these. After I got the adapter I plugged it in and smoothly installed the right drivers, and the adapter was up and running. Immediatley however I noticed the limited range. The adapter itself could only pick up networks within 20-25 feet. My router was about 30 feet and one floor away from the desktop I was using this adapter in and the adapter could barely find the network let alone connect. The day after my first day with the adapter it refused to pick up any of my networks. I was very frustrated and decided to move my router within 20 feet of the adapter, but still I was unable to connect. Frustrated I decided to try again the next day. The next day came and now windows is reporting the adapter is reporting a problem. So I got about a half an hour of internet out of this adapter before it broke.

Pros:
Small
Looks Good
Cool Anttena

Cons:
Poor Quality
Terrible Range
Drops Connections Frequently

Conclusion:
My advice to those of you who are looking at this adapter is to stay away, save your money, and buy a name brand adapter. Also I would get a refund, but this adapter only cost me 5.50$ so it's not worth the postage to send it back."

None of my 6 computers(or 2 other cameras)can read what's on the card. I have tried everything and started to think that something might be wrong with my camera. Went out and got another SD card, different brand, no problems what-so-ever."
4542154,1.0,"Worked great, but I wish it had a polarity reversal option on the output.  Had to solder-up an adapter because the guitar pedal I got this for needed center - negative, which is an oddball spec on the pedal-maker's part, not a fault in the power pack."

I have my dual band installed underneath the top, like their example pictures show, and a 450D underneath. I have an external speaker sitting on top, along with my note pad and SWR meter sits beside it. My straight key fits next to the 450D like it was in a garage. I can use it there, or pull it out. Makes things much neater. I have a pair of mic hangers on order that I will mount on the side. See attached."
3120864,0.0,"Didn't work right out of the box. Tried everything, from resetting all power a couple times and replugging the cables, different cables, and nothing. Learned later when I tried to hook my stuff up as it was formerly that this burned out my receiver and a an HDMI splitter I had down stream from this. This happened because I tried first hooking up to the splitter, and then thinking that perhaps that combination was the issue, I tried hooking directly to my receiver. Fortunately I noticed it burned those two things out before I tried hooking directly to my TV. I am very competent about all this stuff and how to hook things up and such, (read all about me on my profile), so take this review as you may, but I say AVOID AVOID AVOID."
1194219,1.0,"When we bought a Blu-Ray player as our first Wireless-N device, I wanted to upgrade our old router.  I saw the deal for this, and couldn't beat the price for the features.

I was a little hesitant based on some reviews of the ""refurb"" product, but took the plunge anyhow.

I have had absolutely no problems with this router out of the box.  I was able to set up my security, attach all my devices and have been running for several months 24/7 with no heat issues.

I was even able to take our old router, and turn it into a bridge (via WRT software) that is working fantastically for the kids room.

Don't be afraid of the refurb!"
5065132,0.0,"The cable didn't work at all. I tried it from my computer's DVI output to an HD tv with a VGA input, no new monitor detected. The same HD tv gets a signal from my laptop via a straight vga to vga cable, and from my desktop via an HDMI connection. The DVI port on my video card also works when connected to a monitor with DVI in, so that pretty much puts the blame on the cable.

The refund price is barely worth the time it takes to package, label, and deliver the package for a refund, so I posted this review instead."
605613,1.0,Very cool & nice style  love it
6536001,0.0,I got it thinking it had the Atheros AR9380 as one reviewer said and that would work great with Linux but the version I got has a Realtek 8812AE which has had terrible performance on Linux. At first I thought it was my router but after some testing I found that card would top out at 10mbps down and 512kbps up and it was unable to connect to my 5ghz AC network.

4469878,1.0,"Well it took some time, but I finally decided to pickup my first mechanical keyboard  I'm glad I did! While this is the first I've personally owned, I've had the opportunity to try my friend's MX Blue Das Keyboard.

I have to say after having a chance to try them both, I personally prefer the feel and sound of the MX Clear switches on the Code Keyboard. In my opinion, the tactile feel of this keyboard is much more rewarding. Each keypress feels hearty and substantial, possibly due to the greater pressure required to trigger the switch. The sound is also terrific, and has the added benefit of not driving your friends crazy at work.

I love the dip switches on the back too, what a great idea! I often work in Vim, and having the keyboard internally map the caps lock to the control key was super helpful. It makes going between computers quite easy no more software fixes!

The one problem I experienced was that my delete key squeaked. Although a little silicone grease on the plastic inserts fixed that right away. I ended up picking up some translucent front-printed switches, and some custom colors too. With the added key puller it's quite easy to customize them to your daily workflow.

Happy typing!"
133861,0.0,"Lasted about a week until I noticed sound cutting in and out.  The problem is about 3-4 inches from the female end.  One or more internal conductors are broken or shorting, causing the cable to only work when the roughly 1-inch-long segment is bent in just the right way."

3201449,0.0,"As others stated, there are no instructions. My recommendation if using this device:
1. Connect the hard drive to the adapter; both power and data.
2. Connect the AC-DC adapter to the wall plug.
3. Wait 5 seconds or so until the disk spins up.
4. Plug the USB connector to the computer.
5. Wait 5 seconds or so for the computer to recognize the drive.

This adapter was tested with 10 different hard drives, two 2.5 SATA, three 3.5 SATA , four 3.5 EIDE (PATA), and one 2.5 EIDE. Each of these drives worked fine when connected inside the computer. The drives were variety of brands and capacities.
In every case, the results with the USB 2.0 port on the computer were the same as with the USB 3.0 port on the computer.
One SATA was not recognized at all, the other four SATA worked fine.
EIDE drive results varied with jumper settings. The right setting depending on the drive, could be MA, SL, or CS. The wrong setting would either be nothing at all or the eject icon in the system tray with no drive indication in Windows Explorer. In this case, the drive might show up in System Disk Management as an unformatted partition. Sometimes drive capacity was correctly identified, other times as an unformatted 8GB partition. With four of the drives, at least one setting would work. One drive would not work with any setting, either giving the system tray icon only, or no indication at all. I am sending this back."

The part of my shoulder strap that has the rubber grip on it does not bend smoothly over my shoulder, it bends one was and only one way, as if it was cardboard of some other crappy ""padding""
I cannot flip it over to use the rubber side as a Sling, I contacted peak design and they gave me some crap excuse about it needing to be broken in,
Here is the reply I got,

Hello,

Thanks for the reply! It should only be bendable in two points on the strap. Though this is something we have seen with some folks and their Slide I reached out to our lead designer and this is what he had to say:

When I get a new slide I actually roll it and knead it in my hands to sort of break it in. It gets wrinkles and creases, but its consistent. and they all even out over time. The strap also feels much softer.

We are working towards a material change to prevent the creasing and need for breaking in, but at this time we have not found a suitable change.

Cheers,
Daniel

I received it this week and it's all that I expected, heavy but not too heavy and as advertised. I use this for the ""sidekick"" style Jobu Design Micro Gimbal/Ballhead Adapter where the head drops 90 degrees to the single drop notch. This is beefy enough to clamp down the ball to support my Canon EOS7DMKll w/battery grip and EF 400mm f5.6 without worry. DPreview.com has a ball head review and after discussing it's capabilities with one reviewer here on Amazon I decided on the B3.  All things being equal what concerned me was Dpreviews opinion of the pan drag on the ball heads reviewed.  In a price point comparison and performance check I had it narrowed down to the Sirui K40X and the Benro B3.  This one in their opinion had the smoothest drag in the panning direction and mentioned that the K40X would not be a good choice. I expect they're correct as my Sirui K10X on my mono pod has a high minimum but smooth panning drag.  The panning drag on the B3 is there in a moderate amount with ""no drag dialed in"" with the lock knob and I think should be fine as it's very smooth.  I'm using the Benro C2970F Versatile carbon tripod and find it a nice match while out ""birding"" yesterday.  So far I'm very happy with the B3."

Initially, things did not work.  Windows automatically found drivers and everything showed installed, but once I plugged in a USB device, nothing was recognized.  I then went to the Silverstone website, downloaded new firmware and drivers, and voila...everything worked perfectly.

Just FYI, the internal molex power connector is not required.  I tired the card without the supplementary power and everything worked fine.  My external hard drives were powered just fine...but they were all USB 2.0 devices.  I then plugged in the molex connection to the PSU and everything still worked fine.  I didn't get a chance to test a USB 3.0 device without the extra power so no notes there.  As to transfer speeds...the only USB 3.0 device I have is an external Western Digital My Passport hard drive.  It's a platter based hard drive so there's the limiting factor.  It transfered files to and from just about the same as my USB 2.0 hard drive. Maybe a little faster.  But I didn't do any scientific tests...I just noticed it wasn't much faster.  If I get a flash based 3.0 device, I'll update this review.

11/1/2010 UPDATE: My ZS3 LCD screen lasted a year so Panasonic replaced it by giving me this new ZS7.

8/1/2012 UPDATE: The ZS7 lens cover malfunctioned after a year so I just ripped out the lens cover so I can use the camera.

You use these in pairs. Put one next to your router or switch.
Then, a second one where you want to have network/internet connection.
You can easily expand your wi-fi range by using a pair of these, and then another wireless router in the affected area/s.
These things are as plug-and-play as it gets.

The way these things work is by sending network signals through your coaxial/satellite tv wiring in your house."

After connecting them and adjusting the equalizer in my laptop, these little guys had full range capabilities. No low bass, but they do have a better deep sound than larger computer speakers I have used in the past. The biggest concern to many is that they don't play loud, but in close proximity, they play loud enough for enjoyable listening. No controls are on the speakers, and are controlled by computer volume. If you need tiny, but nice computer speakers, these are perfect!

PS: These do work with a TV if you can power them via USB behind a TV, and if it has a 3.5mm audio out jack. If your TV does not have a USB in the back, you can buy a wall adapter (just like the ones used for phone chargers). If you have RCA out, you need a y-cable adapter to work (single female 3.5mm to male RCA left and right). You should be able to adjust audio settings on the TV if they do not play automatically when plugged in, by changing the setting to allow TV volume to adjust external speaker volume. Hope this helps with connecting to TVs."

First time I put them on everything seemed brighter and... crisper. Or I thought it was crisper. There's actually a slight magnification in these lenses which I thought was the image being clearer at first. After wearing them for several hours a day over 3 days I just cannot do it anymore. Without the magnification I think these lenses would have been great, but with it, I simply cannot use them. I have kids so I often look away from my screen to interact with family or watch TV. Focusing on anything more than 6' away is a definite eye strain so I had to remove them every single time I looked away.

When I bought this iPod for running with the armband, I had to reinstall iTunes to have the iPod to even be recognized as an mp3 player in my computer. Wow. The nerve of Apple.

This is not my opinion, this is fact. 3 days later of ripping my hair out, I realize why I left Apple in the first place. iTunes does not play well with others.

It is thoughtfully designed (you can turn of dial's light on and off to save power), has multiple ways of powering it, and even in our dead zone in rural western Maine picks up more FM stations (loads) than any of our other radios.

Fast accurate focus at burst speeds of 10 frames per minute. Comparable ISO performance of the 5D mk III up to 32,000. Then the 5D has the advantage in less noise.

6643079,0.0,"After just over a year I'm facing an issue where drives 4 and 5 turn on and off taking my volume offline. It may have even killed drive 5. Pulling drive 5 allowed me to save my data (thankfully). A replacement drive exhibits the same symptoms so it's definitely the device. After a week with barely any email communication (twice they asked for my logs so I sent them over and over) and nobody answering the phones I am stuck with a $550 paperweight that may never be fixed. I understand electronics can fail but if nobody is there to support you or back up their product then it is just not worth the risk. If I'd built my own system with standard components it would be cheap and easy to replace a motherboard or power supply. Not this thing. The power supply is $169 and you can't just buy a motherboard for it. The QNAP experiment is over. I will roll my own from now on. If you read this, at least check out synology or freenas."
2217004,0.0,"Brand new out of the package and taking about 20 pictures, I started getting an error message the card was damaged.  I removed from the camera, moved the pictures to my PC and tried once again, this time formatting the disc in the camera.  Once again, after taking a handful of pictures, I had the same results.  To rule out the card from the camera, a Nikon D3100, I swapped SC cards with another camera,Sony DWC-W800 which immediately identified a damaged SC card.  I  know others have had great luck with these and as with anything mass produced, there will be some ""bad apples"" of which I received.

Since this did not fall under ""Amazons Dead on Arrival"" policy, sending back for a refund was not possible.  Contacting Silicon Power was no help either as they referred me back to Amazon."
4180710,0.0,"Pros - It is fast.  My wireless speeds went from 50 Mbps to 85 Mbps using this and a Dlink DWA182 interface device.  Easy to set up.

Cons - 1.) This router does not seems to be able to give me the total speed of my cable line which is 100 Mbps.  With the Dlink DIR-645 router I was able to get wired speeds of 95-110 Mbps.  The top speed I have seen wired in through Cat 5 cable or wireless is about 87 Mbps on the GHz 5 channel.

2.) The worst thing about this router is that it does not seem to be able to hold a connection either wired or wireless.  I am constantly seeing my Yahoo Messenger window on my screen close the connection and then relog on.  This is very frustrating when I am try to download music through Shareaza because it reset all the connections to all the serves it is hooked to.  This cause it to take about 5 minutes to re-establish all its connections.  About that time it get reconnected, it drops everything all over again and starts reconnecting all over again.  This is the second AC1900 I have had and both of them did the exact same thing.

3.) After about 4 hours of being on-line my connection speeds drop from 87 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.  If I disconnect and reconnect I will get connection speeds of 87 Mbps.

4.) There is no MAC filtering on this router which was a nice feature on the DIR645 router that I am replacing.

I just don't think that this router is quite ready as far as firmware or hardware is concerned."

That's within the 3 year warranty, but WD makes it a pain to return - not that it would solve the lost data. This was never dropped, never left the house, and almost never left one room. Before that, i really liked the drive, but not the software.

6306448,0.0,"Like a previous reviewer, I also did not receive the mini tripod, so it's good that I don't need it. It still is bad form to sell something and not deliver it.

A more important problem is that the batteries do not fit in the provided charger. I haven't seen this problem mentioned in previous reviews, so the seller may have mixed up my order. The batteries do fit in my Panasonic G3 charger and I was able to charge them that way. The batteries fit in my G3 and the power indicator works. I have not taken them out for extended use, so I cannot say whether they last as long as the Panasonic battery or if the power indicator works the same upon discharge.

As a cheap alternative to the Panasonic battery, I guess this works if you can accept a useless charger and missing throw ins. I'll keep the batteries as they seem to work and it's not worth the hassle to get a working charger from the seller."

There is no reason for Roku to ask for that info simply to let me proceed with the set up. I can't believe they want my credit card info after I have paid for the device and paying for Netflix already, and won't let me proceed with the set up.

A standing case was mandatory for me as I often read at my desk or a table.  A loop for holding the reader with one hand while sitting in a chair was the second feature I had also been hoping for.  I thought I could modify this case for that.  Turns out it isn't necessary.  It is very comfortable (for me) to hold this case with three fingers just where the back side angles away (to form the back leg of the triangle), with my little finger hooked under the bottom.

Initially, I was going to use BIC's larger DV62si speakers, since I have a set as my fronts (with the matching center DV62CLS), however I was reluctant to wall-mount such heavy speakers; these DV52sis  are smaller, much lighter, and have keyhole mounting options, so I decided to give them a shot. I am amazed at the sound quality of these little speakers! To test them, I hooked them up to the receiver in my bedroom, in place of some old KLH speakers. Though they sounded a bit thin and underpowered out of the box, I left the radio on for about an hour & went out. When I returned, I was stunned at much fuller, richer, and louder these speakers sounded! I'm no audio expert, so I can only descibe the sound as rather ""creamy""; highs are crisp without sounding harsh or shrill, mids sound full, and lows are surprisingly, well, low, especially for the DV52si's size and plastic housing. I love the sound so much, I've ordered two more sets!

If you want to avoid this, you need to find a clock that use the NIST WWVB radio station signals to set them (often advertised as ""atomic"", even though the clock itself isn't maintained by an atomic clock, but the radio source is).

While this does work very well on my Kindle, I found myself using it for other things more and more.  I have used it clipped to the back of our entertainment center to hook up the components.  We have used it in our house as a night light.  It goes for several nights on one set of batteries.  I have used it for all sorts of things where one would use a clip or a stand light with a flexible neck.

Other people have said that the light has a problem with glare on the Kindle screen.  This is true, but it is actually a function of the Kindle surface, and not the light.  The other lights I tried do the same thing.  It is easy enough to just move the light up higher to solve that problem.

We like this light so much that my wife and I both have one on the head of the bed.  It's the perfect light when you need to go around late at night without waking the whole house up.

It actually works well on those primitive paper based books, but better for hardbound than paperback.  Of course some of the paperbook crowd will never touch this light, preferring to use tallow candles or sputtering oil lamps.

2046337,1.0,"I recently received this product for my car. I imported a car from Japan and the FM frequency is limited to 76-90 Mhz so I wanted a FM transmitter so I could still listen to music in my car.

I also like that I can charge my iPod as I listen. iPod is really easy to connect and disconnect and it stays locked in place as I drive.

My only problem is that I live in a country with Roundabouts so when I turn the product can slide to the left and I have to reposition it (the ipod remains in place but the entire unit shifts). So an additional securing strap would help. But this is a minor problem. All in all, a very good product."

I found that this is a common problem with this TV, and it usually starts to exhibit this problem, oh ... just after the 1 year warrantee expires.

I've gone to have it repaired, and the estimated cost is $829.00 & the repair shop said that they can't guarantee the repair because the part that's needed is known to fail repeatedly.  Needless to say, the repair wasn't done.

548993,0.0,Got 2 units and immediately put one into service. Left the other in it's box. Finally opened the second unit and it did not work at all. Then I noticed the second one had scratches on the back where you would hang it on a nail or screw. The front was dirty and dusty. Unfortunately I was past the time limit on returns to Amazon. Amazon would not take it back. Called Belkin and exchanged the used one for an equivalent item. Belkin sent the wrong one as a replacement and is currently working on sending me the correct one.  Belkin's customer service was easy to deal with and very helpful. The other unit works fine but I gave this review one star in that Amazon shipped me a used unit that did not function and I could not send it back for a replacement. The moral of the story is check out all your items right away and save some headaches.

5688816,0.0,"These headphones sound HORRENDOUS!  I'm hoping they were defective, but since left and right channels sound equally bad- I'm questioning that. I've had fifteen dollar pyles attached to my waterproof ipod shuffle that sound every bit as good.  These also sound orders of magnitude worse than my pair of sony waterproof walkmans- and don't stay on any better.  The reason I bought these is I was hoping for a bump in sound quality, as well as to allow me to do flip turns with full force, but oh how I erred!  The sound is flat, pale and just thoroughly cheap sounding- and full force flip turns still jar both units equally- but since the sony's and these both have a very similar profile- there's nothing surprising with that. Do yourself a favor and get the sony's.  Sound soooo much, much better and with the built in player- much easier to manage."
4779538,0.0,"I received this in exchange for an honest review.  Unfortunately, it did not work out of the box. There is a small remote control with battery. Either the battery is dead or the remote doesn't work. The overall quality of the entire unit suggests it was made in China (and the box confirmed that,) so it's not worth me troubleshooting. Also, there is no way (or no apparent way) to tilt the phone down towards you. The phone sits at a 90 degree angle to the stick, which means it won't capture someone below it.  Either the design is horrible or I am overlooking something not intuitive. There were no instructions to clarify.  Finally, I wouldn't trust the stick to hold my phone securely without dropping it.

Edited to add: the pairing instructions do not list an iphone 6 as compatible, although this website does. One or the other needs to be updated."

It is also more durable than I imagined, not meaning I'm abusing it, but making it a point to actually care for my purchase. I recently put it in some tree branches without any issues or ripping. Definitely worth the price and is easy to change colors or sides. The only thing I noticed is that the casing that you zip up is a little tight, which really isn't a problem, just something to notice.
Great price, product, and seller!"

Alas...when you buy a Harmony One you are absorbing the support from the company that created it...Logitech.  And their support goes beyond poor, to downright dangerous.

I own two Harmony One devices (as I said, I love the way they work).  Last year, one of the devices starting ""misbehaving"".  An easy solution for any computerized device is reboot it, right?  The way you reboot the Harmony One is pull the battery, wait a few seconds, and push it back in.  No big deal.  Usually.  This time, the battery simply wouldn't come out.  When I finally DID get it out, I found the battery to have swollen at least 30%.  I called Logitech, they sent another battery, no big deal.

Second remote had EXACTLY the same problem this last weekend.  Contacted Logitech, and was told this swelling was ""normal"".  Um, no.  It's not.  It's actually quite bad.  And rather dangerous.

If you do a simple search, you'll find pages and pages and pages of Logitech owners of 800/900 remotes as well as the One with this problem...some with cracked cases, some with battery covers that won't close anymore, etc.  And Logitech's response is that this is ""normal"".

I highly recommend looking for other solutions."

I hate the material, even though the keychain loop is thick enough and strong enough, the tip is so thin and flimsy that after a month of ownership the thin white tip is cracked in 3 places and the same piece of plastic(the white one is cracked vertically in 2 other places on both sides where it is reinforced by the black plastic, oddly enough none of the black plastic has cracked at all, so I'm stuck wishing they had used a sturdier material where the white plastic is present

I haven't had any speed issues with this drive, i just wish they were formatted to start off as exfat or ntfs, both which are better for the capacity of this drive

if the white plastic was replaced i'd give this 5 stars, but if a product can't stand up to light usage for more than a month it isn't worth anyone's hard earned money"

  I have used discwashers for almost 35 years.  They do a good job of cleaning the gunk off old records.

  Some folks recommend a dry system once your records are clean; I always have trouble getting that last bit of dust off . . . you can generate static and wind up attracting more dust than you brush off.  Amazon has dry brushes as well.

6195721,1.0,"I have owned this lens for about three months now, and all I can say that NO other lens will even comes close to beating the picture quality of this lens. I have tried the new 600mm f4 ii of canon. It is a fantastic lens, but in order to get the same focal length you need to use 1.4x TC (slightly larger at 840mm). The picture quality is not comparable to 800mm. I have seen so many review on internet that the new 600mm would make the 800mm obsolete, but I beg to differ. I have done extensive testing of the two lenses, and in every test the 800mm came superior in picture quality and sharpness and vibrancy. I also own Canon 300mm f2.8 ii and Canon 500mm f4 ii. They both are state of the art lenses, however, the 800mm is superior in picture quality compared to both of them. May be I have recieved the perfect copy. You can study the MTF charts and listen to all kind of reviews, but nothing beats what you see when the pictures are laid in front of you side by side. If you need the focal length and have the money, this is the lens to get. There is not much difference in weight when you use the 600mm f4 ii with 1.4x TC iii and 800mm, but believe me that there is a big difference in picture quality."

I got it to pair with my Note II once, running 4.1, and it didn't work very well on most things. It would continue to pair on the Note II but no longer work, regardless of whether I had the Nyko app installed.

It paired successfully with my 2013 Nexus 7 on 4.3 but never functioned. I called Nyko and they offered me a swap, but that controller didn't work either. I tried the Nyko app, but no go on that.

List of ""paired but no function"" devices and operating systems over the last few months:
GSM Galaxy Nexus, 4.2
CDMA Galaxy Nexus, 4.2
GSM Nexus 4, 4.3
Lenovo Twist, Windows 8
Apple iMac, OS X 10.9

Until Nyko fixes the compatibility with Android 4.x, this thing is a no-buy. Which is a shame because the controller itself feels fantastic, the triggers are great, but it just doesn't work. At all."

3434567,1.0,"Bluetooth speakers are almost a dime a dozen these days. Every company is releasing entire lines of them and it's for good reason. They're awesome. This one really stands out from the pack for two reasons. The first is the sound. The sound in this speaker is comparable to the Logitech UE, which is the best sound I believe I have ever heard from several BT speakers. For the size it puts out some fairly incredible bass and it doesn't distort even at its highest volumes, which are window-rattling levels. Second is the look. The picture doesn't do a lot of justice, but it's not a bad looking unit at all. A lot of speakers are over-the-top and almost cheesy looking. This is sleek, sharp and will look good sitting on the shelf versus something that's big, purple and makes you want to throw it in a drawer as soon as you are done with it.

I love this speaker. It comes highly recommended."

Pros
self healing (scratch it and a fews day later it is gone)
nice feel (nice and smooth feeling not sticky like other screen protectors)
strong build

Personally, I haven't tried one of these little 9"" units, but in view of the bad experiences I and so many others of my fellow employees have had with CTL crap, why on earth would I consider paying for one?

1175742,1.0,"I am a long time Nikon user/fan but have held off spending the bucks for DSLR. I became interested in digital photography and using a Canon point/shoot have taken some decent pix but adjustments are cumbersome. My grandson shares my love of photography and has a D-90 so when I began looking he recommended it. After much research I bought the kit from Amazon and have not been disappointed.

I also bought David Busch's users guide to make things easier and I recommend it. Controls are well laid out and within a few days I was able to set up for all kinds of shooting from indoor still life and portraits to outdoors and moving subjects. Being familiar with manual camera operation, I found the D-90 a snap to set up. The many preset auto settings cover most point and shoot situations quite well and I fine tune those as necessary. The kind of shooting I do suits the kit lens although I am able to use several of my older manual focus (Al)lenses. I do plan to get some faster single glass for portraits in low natural light

This machine takes photos in places so dark that I can barely see the subject and using raw files allows for infinite adjustment of the pix. This is a lot of camera for the buck. Probably not for the average snapshot folks but for us non-pros who want control of the camera it is ideal. It's been 3 months and several hundred exposures and I'm very pleased."

Instead, search for 32-bit Cardbus adapters such as the ones made by Viking, Delkin, or Lexar, which are many times faster but not much more expensive.  And, they fit in the same PC card slot on most laptops made in the last decade. The 32-bit cards I have used are even a bit faster than USB 2.0 and Firewire.

You can spot 32-bit cards by the gold strip at the top of the card. No gold strip? Then prepare to wait an hour or more for your data to transfer, while your laptop is brought to its knees. The old silver cards may be fine for storing and playing mp3s, or may be needed for laptops made more than 10 years ago, but any large amount of data--such as GBs of photos or video-- will take quite a while to copy over.

I also tried this in my house. with the fobs in front of me, they worked less than 30% of the time. This is not going to work. I do not know why, should not to too tuff, but they fail.

4406261,0.0,"At first glance, these are very nice devices.  If you are using them at home they may well be wonderful systems and would rate at a much higher level.  In the industrial area where I work they have two fatal flaws, one of which may not be a problem for other users.  The one which disqualifies this as a practical device is the inability to open text files with Windows Notepad.  So far, their tech support hasn't come up with a solution and they are useless paperweights.  The other issue which is more of one in industry than with most home users:  we have a lot of machinery that is still very functional but the computers run Windows 98.  Upgrading isn't practical and we require Windows 98 support.  The underlying hardware and software (Linux plus Samba) can do this, but the company doesn't support it and there is something in the way they have it configured that prevents the standard techniques from working.  If you don't use Windows 98 (or earlier) then it isn't a problem.  But the text file problem is unacceptable.  If they get me a solution I'll update the review.  Otherwise, this isn't a good product.
10/2/15 Update.  I was able to determine fixes to both problems.  BUT, with absolutely no help from the vendor.  So, if you need these features and are willing to muck around in the configuration files you can make it work.  Takes too much time for something they shoujld know already.  The review stands at a 1 star."
4054701,0.0,"First off, I just got the radio yesterday so I'm not going to comment about longevity.

Pros
Cost, this is a inexpensive radio.
Functions, I wanted a new radio so I could listen to music from my phone or a USB at work.  This has a 3.5 mm and USB port + AM, FM, FM stereo, CD.
Size, it is a very portable radio.
Good reception on FM

Cons
The sound quality isn't the best but it's good for the price of the radio.
The radio doesn't remember where it stopped on the USB.

Both con's are minor points for me but I'm happy with the radio for the price I paid for it.

This is a edit to my review.  The CD player stopped working so I bought a Sony $50 boombox and it had much better sound."

A button mounted next to the radio turns on the camera and it is displayed in the rear-view mirror.  The in-dash DVR?GPS does a good job displaying a License plate mounted back-up camera.

I would connect all of my devices to the hub and then sync up one of my TVs in the living room with the surround sound to one button on the remote and the other TV in the living room with the soundbar to another button on the remote. When everything was connected and set up, all of the stored syncs would seem to flip flop and randomly turn on/off whichever device it seemed to feel like or make contact with (at least that's certainly what it felt like). The app on my phone, albeit hard to navigate, could actually turn all of my devices on and off individually. After spending several hours trying to get it right, using both the computer and my cell phone, I finally gave up on it and returned the product. The best experience in all of this was how easy it was for me to return via Amazon.

I really wanted this remote to work as it has a lot of positive reviews and any way to minimize the now 7 remotes I have would've been great. This looked like the best remote option that didn't have a touchscreen. I wanted real physical buttons with no screens. I will probably try Logitech again because the hardware seemed to be built quite solid and they are a big name, but for the time being the software on this device let me down big time."

Make sure you download the software for it since its the only way to get a good balance between mouse speed and touchpad speed - and you get the horizontal scrolling by tilting the wheel.  The logitech download is a bit confusing though.  Find the download for the cordless mouse.  It should be about 50mb.  The smaller file doesn't do anything useful.

  Unfortunately, it wouldn't run for more than about 6 hours before freezing the network.  Sometimes the subnet (inside the firewall) would remain working, sometimes not.  I upgraded the firmware, tried several different configurations, reset the thing repeatedly, and always had the same problem: when network traffic got heavy (say, when my web server got several requests or when several of us were using the network), the thing would freeze, requiring a hardware reset.

I already know from the limited RCA manufacturer warranty that something like this won't be covered, though I contacted them anyway. I feel this manufacturer needs to either advertise this as just a pretty she'll for aesthetic purpose only, or the whole design needs to be thrown in the garbage and they need to figure out a different way to holed the screen stationary without being anywhere near the tight, paper thin gap between the tablet, and keyboard.

The platform I needed, that will run the compiler and environment I needed, and the most amazing thing....is that the other drive is visible, so you can keep all source code or other docs on the main drive (which gets backed up all the time), and has PLENTY of space to boot (no pun intended).

917320,0.0,"The leather on this case is very nice. The case has two major flaws, however--

1) It is too tight. you have to take the ipod out to charge it and this is way too hard to do..

2) The plastic cover inside which is supposed to provide extra protection doesn't  work - It sticks to the face of the ipod in odd ways so that when you glide your finger in one direction over the wheel, the plastic film sticks, then unsticks itself. This is interpreted by the nano as your finger continuing  to glide on the wheel, only in the opposite direction. This results in a little comedy routine - you glide your finger in one  direction on the wheel to move down a menu, say. As soon as you pick your finger up. the plastic cover peels itself off the wheel and the menu selection moves back up to where you started. Thus begins the great battle of the plastic film. You try to outsmart it, moving  past your menu choice in the hope that when you lift you finger it will go back to what you really wanted. On and on.

It is SO frustrating that I end up taking my ipod out of the case to do simple things like change the volume or select a song. And remember, it is NOT easy to take the nano out of the case.

All in all, a loser.  Avoid this case."

When it will scroll, it doesn't last long and it can scroll in any direction it feels like and forever how long it wants. This happens in documents, spreadsheets and on the web. It simply doesn't work. To make matters worse, this problem has been around for years, so Microsoft must be aware of it but has evidently done nothing about it.

262313,1.0,"I already own the ""on the ear"" Grado SR60 and the wireless Sennheiser RS170.  Both are excellent.  These were my points of reference for comparing my new purchase.

I was looking for an ""over the ear"" set to listen to short wave AS WELL AS portable MP3's and Pandora without disturbing those around me.

Initially thinking that extremely faithful reproduction was not that important for my primary use, I looked at the less than $50 cans.  I learned this was a mistake.  Among the best rated among the less expensive units was the Monoprice, which is what I ordered.  After testing and comparing it with my other phones, I determined they were unacceptable.  They lacked ""air"" and sounded like there was excessive harmonic distortion, possibly from reverberation inside the fairly large cans.  Choral lyrics were distorted, not from cone breakup, but from internal resonance, I suspect.  Those were returned and I upped the ante and ordered this Sony.

The Sony sound is dryer, not as much low-mid, but cleaner mids and highs.  These phones will rival the two really nice ones I already own, but with a different purpose.

The form factor is also better:  lighter, less bulky, and more comfortable than the Monoprice, feeling very much like my Senns but with a wire."

I paid the computer repair store $25 to look at it and they told me that the disk doesn't spin for long enough to get the computer to recognize the drive and none of their software repair was able to get to the data.

Despite misgivings, I went ahead and purchased this DVD burner. For roughly three months, my fears were unfounded as it performed without a hitch. In the fourth month, problems started to creep in, with more and more discs being improperly burned. Then, at the end of the month, the machine just gave out entirely.

My advice is not to waste time and money on this machine. If my experience is duplicated, and I see no reason why it wouldn't be, it is subject to a higher failure rate than similar burners from other makers.

2. can be a bit slow in responding
3. 90 day warranty (seriously?!)

I know it's not a problem with the remote control as the remote works just fine for my brother's BDX2250 blu-ray player, but neither my remote nor his remote will work now with mine!!

Remember that 90 day warranty? Yeah, it's out of warranty now, so Toshiba won't help me at all with the problem, won't replace it, won't fix it. I didn't know it came with a 90 day warranty, honestly not sure the product description mentions that.

Soo... now I'm out $80 and a blu-ray player. Best I've been told is take it to a repair center, but the estimate from Best Buy Geek Squad to just 'troubleshoot' it (not even fix it, just the start-up cost) would be $100!

When you are trying to control -- and switch between -- many devices, the sequence that you operate the devices is very important.  Get out of sequence and the remote is useless until you get it reset.  Returned to Amazon."

3030994,1.0,"I'm really impressed with the product. It has a very good solid feel when it is in your hand. The thought that your iPod is securely protected behind layers of materials makes you feel good. Definitely, you don't have to handle the iPod Touch 5th Gen gingerly anymore. This is great because it releases you of attention no matter how small it is on the safety of this fun gadget. Don't you think this is worth the price to pay for?

When my iPhone 5 crashed on the tarmac one day after I received it, I was traumatised. If only a protection is added to it, I said to myself, it would have saved me from a sleepless night.

Protection is necessary. It keeps you away from the gadget back to the attention and tasks which make up a productive day. Let's face it. No matter how insignificant we think any scratches on the iPod is, there is this tinge of dissatisfaction deep within that if only something has been done about it, it would not have happened.

By the way, before I wrote this review, my iPod just slipped out of my pocket and dropped on the ground :-) But I know it is safe with Otterbox."

Great sound quality- not audiophile quality, but I'm impressed.  I would definitely buy again.  Using with my iPad so I don't accidentally jerk the ipad into the floor when I move around my cubicle or exercise.

Update:  7/2015 Still like my headset.  The original set started getting a slight buzz on certain higher note- especially on piano music.  They were out of warrantee, so when they went on daily special in July I purchased another pair for myself.  They've made some upgrades on the firmware using updated Bluetooth and voice commands- nice features.  CAVEAT:  The upgrade to Bluetooth 4.0 interacts differently with Apple products.  On the previous generation you could adjust the volume individually on the iPad or headset.  Now the headset actually controls the iPad volume. I use these at work and typically listen at a very low level to isolate noise and increase concentration.  With upgrade I was unable to get the volume low enough for my listening enjoyment, probably 6db too loud.  Not a problem for everyone.  I learned of this issue after contacting MEE.  I synced the new set to my Android device and all is good.  Just a warning for you."

It is too bad because it set up nicely with a matching Samsung LCD TV and sounded reasonably good (though I agree that the subwoofer is a bit strong).  Sometime less is more and in this case it would have been better to skip the DVD rather than put out a device with an apparently high failure rate.

1943352,0.0,"Like many people, I got this so I could run more than just two monitors with my Eyefinity-capable device.  Let me start out by saying that yes, it does that job effectively.

There is something odd, however...

Sometimes, the monitor that is connected with this connector just blinks out now when it didn't used to before this.  It will also do this strange horizontal scroll, just one that is very fast, and then it locks back into place, as though there is a timing issue.  In fact, now that I think about it, timing issues would explain both of those problems, as an active Displayport adapter handles timing (if I understand correctly).  I supposed it's possible that I got a defective unit.  I do know that it isn't the monitor's fault, as it was connected with a passive Displayport adapter before and never gave me one second of grief.

EDIT:  I originally had good feelings about this, but that has changed.  I returned the first adapter after being annoyed with the regular screen blips and blackouts and got a second one.  It did the same thing within the first 30 minutes, so I'm getting a refund on it and trying a completely different adapter.

Take note that this adapter is NOT AMD/ATI certified.  I'm going to try one that claims to have that certification in the hopes that it works as expected.

At this point, I simply cannot suggest this item for purchase."

1194182,0.0,"I have had Sirius since 2005. I love Sirius radio, the only issue I have with it is the equipment! I have gone through 4 head units in 5 years. It is very obvious this stuff is built to fall apart. The provided antennas have had to be replaced a few times. the connectors become lose causing the ""no antenna detected"" nightmare. The boom box I also bought in less than 6 months had power cord issues. I've had to take head units apart to solder parts myself just to get a few more miles out of them before buying new ones. They give you the ""luxury"" of being able to move the head unit from one car to another or to the house or boom box, but over time pulling and pushing the head unit from docking stations begins to break it down. With all the money I spent on equipment replacement, I was probably better off from the start just buying 2 head units with 2 subscriptions and never touching the dam things. My starmate 5 just took a crap.it is just about a little over a year old and now I'm off to buy yet another head unit. I recommend Sirius to everyone, but Sirius, your equipment is junk.

Shoddy construction. Metal ring is soft, and the rubber hood is warped. Marginal functionality for a standard lens, but not worth it for a telephoto zoom because it's simply too wide.

6657595,0.0,"I purchased this product almost exactly 2 years ago. It started rebooting intermittently. I swapped everything out until I was convinced that the board was the issue. I called ASUS and was told it was still under the 3 year warranty. You have to pack it up and mail it to them. So, I wrapped it in cardboard to protect the socket and shipped it off. I got an email today that contained an image of bent pins in the CPU socket. It was booting when I was troubleshooting it, and I don't believe I damaged the pins before shipping since I am careful, however I tried to put a cover in the socket from another ASUS motherboard and that may have bent them accidentally. So, the end result is that they want 150$ to fix the socket and repair the board now. This bothers me since the tech told me when I sent it in that I should take pictures to prove it in case they found damage on the board when received. Sounds like this is a common problem with ASUS and so I will be looking for another company who doesn't look for an excuse to not repair their parts. I didn't do it intentionally and its cheaper to buy another board. Goodbye ASUS!"

The resolution is lower than claimed in the description.  The arm to prop up the frame is constructed such that the frame leans too far back, which makes for a poor viewing angle.  I have to push the buttons on the remote very hard several times before the picture frame receives the signal.  The SD memory card slot does not have spring action, which means it will eventually wear out after many uses and the SD card will not stay in the slot.  Memory card slot faces down, further ensuring that the memory card will fall out.

I contacted Amazon and was told this wouldn't happen again. They shipped replacements... with the same issue.  I've returned for refund.  Clearly, their supplier has mislabeled the product and the automated warehouse is simply picking and shipping.  My plea for human intervention fell on deaf ears so I'm not sure what it takes to get their attention.

The product itself is okay.. if you get the right one.  I've had several.. .although.. be aware every set I've had has broken in the middle of the back... so I've ended up taping them back together and they last for a year or so. It's a weak point in the design.  Unfortunately, there aren't many options in this form-factor.

Install the software FIRST as instructed, then quickly plug in the USB cord, it will open the images, load them to a website, email them or your can send them to your harddrive.  It opens a fold in My Pictures for you.  You just check which pictures you want to keep and which you want to get rid of.  You have the option of keeping the images on the smart card or you can erase them.
So from box to shooting a few minutes, about 5 to install and reboot.  Second to plug in to the computer and instant pictures of SUPER quality.  I could not believe how sharp the images were.
You are able to chose to look threw the lens to set it up as with regular SLR.  Or you can compose by looking at the LCD image. Once the image is snapped it shows you a copy on the LCD viewer so you can see the shot. It has 6 times zoom and auto flash.

I have emailed the company with no satisfactory response.  If you ever intend to go beyond XP avoid this company at all cost.  Their other products too because they still list this product as current yet do not support it.  A very bad sign for the integrity of a company.

I removed the nub and the battery mounts on the back of the camcorder perfectly. After charging, however, I get a message that this battery can't be used and the camcorder shuts down after a few seconds.

I really have to question why Panasonic feels the need to change batteries from very similar cameras when there is no reason to or to put in sensing circuitry to stifle consumers from using competing, and cheaper, brands. I suppose it's because of their idiotic prices for their brand of batteries.

I will give this battery to my wife to use on her HC-V500, which it does fit on and works properly."

3363241,0.0,I received this computer and proceed to charge it  prior to my first use.  i went to turn it on and the power button was not responding at all.  i disassembled it and realized that the power switch had become un soldered.  i had to re solder the power switch to the mother board.  From there i was able to turn the computer on.  once it booted i realized that the hard drive had not been wiped and in fact had a user account on it which was locked with a password which made it IMPOSSIBLE for me to restore it back to factory condition.  this is a major pain for me as i am deployed over seas right now and have no access to all the tool i need.  Needless to say i had to put another hard drive into it and install a copy of windows 7 i have since i don't own windows 8.  so now the computer partially works and i am un able to download the required drivers from acer to make it work.  and those drivers are for windows 8 not windows 7 so they probably won't work when i get the chance to download them.  I would love a restore disk but this thing came with minimal paperwork.  This is a complete unprofessional job.  if i wasn't over seas i would be returning this product.

  A few reviewers' complained about the noise, it's minimal during backup and afterwards there is a neat little on/off switch on the back.  I suspect that the drive noises that you hear after backup are all those little pieces of software attempting to ""call home"" as they do on your internal drive.

The arrow keys don't work properly... It stuck to a word underlined that is for auto correction and doesn't move away the blinker. What is this design?

Then I emailed them for support as they tried to get better rating by doing so. They failed, because the email relied me was to suggest I TRY some instructions. ""FN F1 for backspace"" F1 isn't even close to that... Then I was told to check the user manual which I already did before contacting them and the menu said so little.

I used this cord/adapter for a little over two months and it quit working.  I did move the monitor each day, and I did unplug it and replug approx.  every day or more.  I noticed that it would sometimes, when connecting or unplug some other power not related, it would blackout the signal momentarily.  I went back to BlueRigger product as I had used  another monitor with HDMI and that BlueRigger cord/adapter lasted with the old monitor about  1 1/2 years.  The BlueRigger cord & adapter for HDMI does not have any momentary blackouts like the Moread had. The BlueRigger comes with a short adapter (8"") and a six foot HDMI cord.  So you get another approx. 8"" added on to the 6' of cord. These cords can fail, depending on how long you use them and how much you move them around.  Appears to work good so far, and I expect it to last as long as the other BlueRigger with the kind of use I do.  If I get 1 1/2 years with the BlueRigger, I will be more than happy.

He loves this type of ear buds, so when I had an opportunity to try these I did. I really love the way you wear them. The lightweight neck and is very comfortable and I sometimes forget it is there. It is also flexible and has the Bluetooth controls on one of the ends. The ear buds are attached via cords that can hang down around you neck when not in use. The positioning makes the buds stay in and the soft tips are comfortable. I never would've guessed that I would love this style of ear bud. While I normally prefer over the ear headphones, I've been using these more and more. The buds are well made, charge fairly quickly and pair easily. Sound quality is much better than expected, better than some other headphones I have, especially from Panasonic. I particularly love using this set for making calls and listening to audiobooks. Music sounds great as well, but I really love these for voice audio. I had purchased a smaller Bluetooth ear piece for calls, but it has been displaced by the Skullcandy Earbuds.

1014022,0.0,"This is the WORST POS that Dish sells.  I am a long time Dish Subscriber (12 years) I have my second 612 and it is as bad as the first one.  At least 2-3 times per week this receiver will just freeze, this requires a ""hard restart"".  It nearly always freezes when you are recording something, thus you lose some of the recording while waiting for it to restart.  You have to call Dish and talk to tech support to complain a couple of times then they will send you another 612 as a replacement.  I sent an email to tech support with these complaints, their answer was that they need to send a service technician out to check it.  This is a complete waste since this will require me to take a day off of work and then they will just give me another POS 612.  Not the ideal solution.  DO NOT PURCHASE this receiver, you'll regret it."

591280,0.0,"I bought this adapter to use with wireless headphones and for syncing my smartphone.

The adapter works great with one huge exception.  If you install this on a centrino laptop, it will most likely crash and corrupt your network drivers.

I tried this with 3 laptops with various implementations of network cards and the adpater driver and software goofs with the TCP/IP settings of the adapters so you can no longer use a network connection.  It seems to work fine with the one desktop I tried.

Basically on a notebook you end up either having bluetooth or an internet connection, but in order to use your internet connection you have to uninstall the bluetooth drivers and software, not particularly convenient.

I went back and forth with Belkin's tech support and they quit responding to messages.  They told me it was a problem with my computers and not the poor quality of their software.  Overall the support for this item was poor at best.

I would stay away from this and consider adapters from other vendors."

3314226,0.0,"I bought this mouse to replace a broken Razer gaming mouse at home. I was also hoping to get some relief from the wrist pain that has been getting progressively worse. As soon as I slipped my hand around this mouse, I felt relief.

It has some quirks, though. The back and forward buttons are at the top of the thumb rest area which is weird. The one I use the most (the back button) is actually close to the crease which is very awkward. Also, the blue light stays on even when the computer is asleep. I didn't really want a nightlight.

Overall, I really am satisfied with the mouse. I will be purchasing one for my wife and one for work.

Pros: feels great, looks great, relieves pain.
Cons: Awkward button placement, difficult to press buttons, light stays on when computer isn't.

9/25/13 Update: The pain relief was short lived. A new pain occurred and now this has a place in the junk box next to the other mice. The arkward button placement caused pain in other places on my wrist after repeated use."

Have lightly used it a few times, and now noticed that the wire is fully out of the female end, shielding is broken, and is ""walking away"" from the connector. This is pure garbage, I've purchased many StarTech cables over the years and have been extremely happy with the quality, this one is a goner, bad construction and maybe a reflection StarTech.com is going downhill.

I'm outside Amazon's return window but will still push them to take the return. I reviewed StarTech's RMA process and it's is ridiculous and cumbersome, likely because of the bad quality they are getting lots of cable failures nowadays. I would have paid upwards of $10 or more for a good cable of this size and thickness, my bad for trusting my device charging to StarTech. BTW The $1.50 eBay cable I've carried right next to this for 2 years is solid as from day 1, so this is definitely a QC issue with modern StarTech cables."

4666124,1.0,"I love the HighView iPad hanger. I have the one that's for the iPad Mini2 Retina and it works fantastic.

I hung the iPad hanger over the back of my seat in the Honda Odyssey minivan and it fit perfectly. Of course, none of that would have been worth a darn if it hadn't also cradled my iPad protectively and securely. Which it did.

My son loved being able to watch what he wanted and to be able to use ear buds on the long drive. This way, he can watch something on the iPad and not worry about accidentally dropping it on the floor.

I can't wait until the next time I take an airplane trip. Those hoity-toity moneybags in first class won't have anything on me with the HighView iPad hanger. Even better, all the choices will be stuff I actually like.

In addition to being a tremendous product in its own right, the HighView iPad Hanger also is produced by a socially ethical company. See, with every hanger purchased, the company donates a month's worth of free water to a Guatemalan classroom that can't afford to purchase it's own supply. Not only do you get to solve your own first-world problem, but you also can help solve a real-world problem.

It's a win-win situation that really does benefit everyone.

3650122,0.0,"Avoid this router.  Netgear Support cannot provide solutions to the main problem - the menus on the router do not match ANY menus in instructions at Netgear.  No one at Netgear support knows anything about this router.  You won't fair any better on the discussion forum.  Plus the router is very slow and freezes for a few seconds for no reason.

There is no way to bring up the Access List option to limit Wireless connections to specific MAC addresses.  After 3 weeks of back and forth emails and getting the same instructions I am giving up.  I will go back on my Verizon Wireless router temporarily and buy another brand.  I will try to sell this unsupported Netgear router.

Another issue is Netgear support staff have very limited English skills and there are no American Support staff members.

Netgear staff does not have the language and/or education skills to ensure that the instructions on the website and the instructions sent by the helpdesk actually mirror the menu options on the wireless routers.  You cannot hand off support from the Asian helpdesks to an American Helpdesk.  The Helpdesks are not stakeholders in your company.  They are only stakeholders with their own companies.  I will disconnect this badly engineered and badly supported piece of crap and try to sell it.  I will never even consider any Netgear products."

5220999,1.0,"I installed it in a Chevy volt. I was about to return it and then loved it! Remember this camera transmits the signal by air, it is difficult to find a good wireless back up camera. And this is a good one. If you do not want to drill holes in your car or do not want ugly words running through your car (then spend money on covering the wires), then this is it! Be sure that the transmitter and the monitor are in the same level, if not your transmission will be weak. I hid the transmitter inside my trunk and then installed the monitor/receiver, in the same level. All these being said, you will never get crystal clear picture (without interruption) as you will get in a wired back up camera. But, I am willing to sacrifice the interruptions and black out for few seconds. It survived couple of car washes. Overall happy, keeping it."

After hooking them up to my iMac, the right speaker, which I assume has the power amp, started making this loud buzzing noise, almost like r/f interference.  Tap the speaker top, noise goes away.  Then it comes back, louder than before.  I tried moving them around, buzzing noise still emanates from right speaker.  tap speaker top, noise goes away. F this.

I wonder why this (the tablet) line of products hasn't caught on....there aren't too many choices out there.

Update - 1 year later: After I purchased an iPod Touch and an iPhone, this product feels old and cumbersome to use. It has been retired now.

Update - 5 years later: WOW - did they really call that little thing a ""tablet"" back then? The iPod/iPhone line just killed it."

1488160,0.0,"I bought this as what I thought was the ideal solution to automatically shut off the air pump I use to dry my son's hockey gear. I set it for 30 minutes and plugged it in. First time, it worked as expected - I hit the button, the fan started up, and when I checked about 45 minutes later, it had shut down. I thought the whole set up was good to go. However, the second time I used it, I happened to check about 2 hours later and the device had not shut off. It was still on the 1/2 hour setting, it just didn't shut off for some reason. It's not a good solution if it's not reliable. Maybe I got a bad unit, for $10, it's not worth the hassle of dealing with a warranty claim. If it did work, it would be nice if it offered more flexibility in the time intervals."

Programing is easy once you get it down. YouTube video by uniden support made it super easy. Alpha tagging feature is really nice. My desktop uniden bc355n finds unknown frequencies better but lacks the great features this has. For any new to scanners this has to be programmed by you. Get online to find your local frequencies then enter them in manually or if you have a pc(windows) you can do it through your computer. Also make sure your area is still analog.

6276768,0.0,"OK, You get what you pay for. This light clips to my Kindle cover well enough but there is no way to clip it on the Kindle itself without blocking reading area or have it clamped over the keyboard. Neither is a good option. Its not sturdy enough to train the light where you want it, and expect it to stay.  The beam is bright in a circle about the diameter of a Silver Dollar and the rest of the reading space is in shadow. It will drive you nuts. The on/0ff switch is tough to slide into position. I should return this piece of crap and get my $6 (incl shipping) back, but I found an alternate use for it. When I use my laptop at night and don't need bright light, it will light up the keyboard enough to see what your hitting. I guess it goes in the circular file when the bulb burns out. Doesn't seem to be a way to get to it without breaking the light.
I guess they send along the key chain as a consolation prize."

444221,1.0,"This lens is solidly built, sharp with excellent color and bokeh. I bought my copy off of Amazon and have been using it for several weeks now. The VR works surprisingly well in micro situations, I was able to shoot 1:1 inside a large bright greenhouse. It's nice to know that it's possible to shoot off the tripod, if the opportunity arises.

The lens does a great job on landscapes and portraits. The color and bokeh are terrific. It not as razor sharp as the Tamron, which is a good thing when you are shooting portraiture as you do not want to see every pore.

If you're looking for a micro that can do additional duty as a portrait and landscape lens, then this is definitely the one to consider. If you want to shoot primarily in micro mode and don't mind the lower build quality, the Tamron is a fantastic lens, and you save some serious cash. It's going to be an expensive purchase one way or another, check out some of the images for yourself by searching for the lens on Flickr or [...]

6123581,0.0,"I've had nothing but trouble from this switch.  I'm using Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 v1.0 and Logitech LX7 Cordless Mouse.

1. Auto switches when one machine reboots and never switches back.  Very annoying when applying patches or installing software that requires a reboot.

2. Has an annoying clicking sound each time it auto switches.  Turn off both machines and it auto switches constantly between the two machines, apparently looking for one that's active.  This really makes the clicking noise annoying.

3. Dell Optiplex GX150 cannot detect keyboard when at boot menu while using this switch.  This makes booting from CD/DVD impossible because you can never ""press any key"" to boot from optical drive.  Not good if you're trying to install an OS.  By the way, Optiplex detects keyboard at boot menu just fine when connected directly.

4. Cordless Logitech LX7 mouse wouldn't work connected to this switch.  Had to revert to older corded Logitech optical mouse.

I ended up throwing this switch out."

This case is very flimsy. By the time it arrived at my door, the case had a major dent in the top left corner. There is a reason this case is cheap/affordable: aluminum is cheap and affordable. Aluminum computer cases are very light weight, but also weak.

This cases sports a clear side panel. DON'T BE FOOLED. This side panel is made of plastic. The post office also scratched that and made it lose the aesthetic benefits. It's quite odd that after I bought it, it dropped $12 the next day. Thank you Amazon for taking the responsibility and allowing me to return this damaged product."
755357,0.0,"This review relates to their proprietary DVD player, filter stick and filter downloading service.  The (USB) filter stick simply does not work with the DVD player.  The DVD player denies it exists.  A replacement stick made no difference. Filter downloads on a second filter stick on a different computer with a different OS and different antivirus protection made no difference.

They have weak online service assistance.  Their online help says ""it's too difficult to put in writing so call us"" and their telephone customer service is open only very limited hours in the work day (Mountain time) so it's far from convenient to the average working joe, especially if you live in the Pacific time zone.  So, unless you want to skip some work (or waste time on Saturday), you are out of luck.

So, I wish it would work, but without a functional filter stick that talks with the DVD player (via its USB port) you are stuck with a mediocre DVD player that will remind you that it doesn't have a working filter when you try to watch a movie, rubbing salt into the wound."
1208499,1.0,"I love this!!  I wish I had purchased one a long time ago......it's lightweight, and does the job!  Prior to this, I had to shut down my laptop periodically to allow it to cool off!! Since day one, this keeps my laptop cooler and I no longer have to turn it off.  It plugs right into the computer USB port and runs while you are using it, then automatically shuts off when you shut the computer down.  It has a small flap under the unit (storage compartment for the cord when it's not in use) that you can open and use to prop your laptop up at an angle....makes is much easier to view and type now.  You can't just push your laptop to move it if you use the flap, you need to lift it and move it, so the little flap stays open...no big deal.* See note! I don't even hear the fan...it's very quiet on mine....for the price, it's a great deal!  I highly recommend it! Would make a great gift!

PS:  At my dollar store, they have little round non skid pads used for opening jars, etc., hanging with the kitchen items like chip clips, etc. This was great to just place under that flap under the Belkin cooler...keeps it from slipping!!"

Much to my surprise once it arrived it performed like a brick right out of the box. I tried to make it faster by removing some of the bloatware and it still did not help. However, it did work okay for reading pdf books (once they loaded if they did). After owning the tablet for about a month and reading 2 books for college the screen rotation quit working and so did the camera. Upon calling the manufacturer for support, the only thing they wanted to do was force me to spend my money to ship the product back to them for repairs. However, inside their packaging they had a card that said ""before returning to place of purchase give us a call, your satisfaction is important"". After fighting with them for nearly 3 months I finally broke down and told Amazon who gladly sent me a return label and refunded my money. Buyer Beware, these tablets are garbage."

2928424,1.0,"I own this model and the larger desktop cousin.  Both works great as advertised but I use them both as cheap Thunderbolt to eSata adapters to hook up RAID systems.  Below is an excerpt from the review for it's big brother.  Everything is the same except this model doesn't need to be externally powered (and is much easier to hide in my server rack), however you will lose the extra Thunderbolt port that it's big brother provides.

For the normal user, this works great.  I had a Seagate external drive with Firewire that I had been using with a MacMini.  When I replaced the interface with this (snap off and snap on) there was a 100% increase in transfer speeds.  That alone makes this device live up to it's claims, but if you're adventurous you can do more.

I had recently purchased a OWC RAID system that I was planning to use with FireWire since it only supports eSata, Firewire, and USB and my MacMini only has ThunderBolt and Firewire.  ThunderBolt RAID systems are rare and expensive ($1500+).  After some searching, I found that this Seagate device is basically a Thunderbolt to SATA adapter.  With a male SATA to eSata cable like this:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P6W8E8/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 you can convert this adapter to a eSata adapter then use it with my OWC RAID and get 5x the speed I was getting over FireWire 800."

4200531,1.0,"Quite honestly, when I agreed to test and review this product, I had no idea how much fun it would be. I even thought, Oh, just another Bluetooth speaker.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  First, the sound is really good for a single speaker device.  You can crank up the volume and still enjoy the music with only minimal distortion.  And it sounds just as good at a low volume.  But the real kicker is the light display, something I wasn't sure I'd like but which won me over immediately.  You can even set the light show to match the tempo of the music.

The BlackDiamond looks both futuristic and retro, a bizarre mix, I admit.  The light show is reminscent of disco, but the shape looks like some sort of crystal in a sci-fi movie.  The included remote control is a blast to use to control the light effects, but, of course, it also controls volume, skipping and returning to tracks, pause/play, mute, and power.

The speaker comes with a storage pouch, a USB/wall charger, and an attached aux jack for wired connections.  This speaker is great fun for parties, and I imagine it would be a hit particularly with the preteen and teen sets.  But as an adult, I love it, too.  Note:  I received a sample for review.

3636451,0.0,"I bought two of these; one for each of my receivers. One for my bedroom upstairs. It's just an average Sony receiver. And the second antenna for my Sony ES receiver in the living room. I get the same cra ppy radio reception on both receivers. No difference in reception performance on either. I even took the time and put out the effort to pin the antennas up on the wall. The ends of the dipole have little plastic tabs with a hole through the middle which I used to pass a push pin through to pin them up on the walls. No matter the position, no matter the angle these antennas do NOT improve your reception much less even GIVE you radio reception.

I use QFlash also because it recharges extremely fast and I never miss a shot. I used to use Canon 580EX and 580EX II flashes but they took forever to charge up and I often missed shots and for a wedding photographer that is inexcusable! With this flash you will need to purchase a battery pack (I use the turbo 3 from Quantum), which you can clip to your belt if you shoot with a photo belt or keep on the stand if you use a stand. It is good for over 1,000 full power shots for weddings and it doesn't heat up so you never miss a shot. It is a fantastic equipment and I will never ever shoot anything without a Quantum Flash!"

152155,0.0,"I am very disappointed with Polk's false advertising.  The PSW505 has no real crossover.  I subtracted a star for that and for lying about it.  Polk's advertising claims that this subwoofer has an adjustable crossover.  It does not have a true crossover.  The full frequency range passes through the sub and to your main speakers.

Subtracted another star for wasteful energy consumption.  Whether you have it set to ON or STANDBY, the power usage is practically the same, about 16 watts when idle.  The only way to keep it from drawing power when not in use is to turn it off completely or unplug it.  That has to be done manually each time.  So in other words, the auto STANDBY feature is pretty much useless and pointless.

Update August 4, 2016: I got the PSW505 back in December or January.  It is now deceased.  The sub either doesn't turn on, or it turns on and then turns off again on it's own and sometimes comes back on and off intermittently, randomly, whenever it feels like it.  Ok, so I guess I'll be taking off two more stars for a short lifespan of less than 8 or 9 months."

I have two complaints however: It is not rechargeable so it uses AA batteries. I would have rather charged it via MicroUSB. The second complaint is that one of the keys fell off rather quickly. I'm not entirely sure if this was user error on my part, but even if it was, the keys should not be able to come off that easily. Fortunately it was the backslash key so it wasn't a huge deal. And I can still press the button, it just doesn't have the key cover if that makes sense.

When I got mine, the heat spreader was not attached but there was some sticky stuff on the chips and this metal block in the case so I did a 1 +1.

So mine died and I did a warranty claim for it.  Got a cross-shipped replacement.  It worked for 3 or 5 months and one night, it shot craps.  When they die, your computer will work 100% fine, and then all of the sudden, apps will start to act weird, maybe crash.  You may be able to power off and reboot...most likely not.  More than likely, you will be able to boot into recover mode an do some random disk scans, check, whatever, but you won't be able to recover anything.
The first replacement then sent a whole new retail replacement.  The second the sent some drive that was packaged as an AWC Mercury SSD instead of an OWC Aura.

I am not a super techy person and don't have a lot of technical info and will warn that this review is at times based upon 4 year old Kindle fire HD(2nd gen.) primary use is web-surfing, and some games-not video intensive games.
First is ease of set-up-  granted having teenagers in house to help was nice-but definitely user friendly.
The display is great.  Very crisp and clear.
Sound quality we thought is more than adequate and we liked the quality-granted this will mostly be paired with Bluetooth speaker.
Easy to use.
The son in law loves his and his is mostly for online games.  Can't say which ones but the processor handled whatever games he played.

Again, it is a tablet, but for the price far pleased with the purchase.  Was deciding between this and the Sam tab 8.  Pleased with the choice.

Final note-somewhere thought I had read that the charging port is Type-c.  It is not and uses the same micro usb have used on all the phones and tablets of past-my bad but thought I would put that out there.

6060147,1.0,"I bought this NAS to consolidate some physical and virtual servers as well as reducing the IT footprint at home.  I installed 4 older 120 GB SSD drives (not on the compatibility list) to host my VMs, as well as three 8TB WD hard drives (on the compatibility list) for data.  So far, I've not seen a need to install M.2 drives for caching, but since I like the ""toys"", I'll probably do so at some point in the near future.

So far, the device is running like a dream.  I have two Windows 2008R2 Servers installed as well as two Windows 7 workstations (one to run Video Editing SW).  When connected via Remote Desktop to the VMs, there is no delay or hesitation of any type.  Basic video editing on the workstation is seamless.

I've split the network ports to two different VLANs, and have no problems with data transfers.  No, I have not performed any official testing where I could post results, but I do not see any issue that would cause me concern.

The only drawback that I'd have to point out, is the fact that I'm unable to migrate my existing Windows 2008R2 hosted VMs to the NAS without external utilities.  Therefore, I had to create new VMs, and move the necessary tools/apps to the new VMs, and shutdown the originals.  This was not such a pain that I'd remove a star from my rating.

Overall, I'd recommend this for any serious NAS user.  I'd buy it again if needed."

The strange part is when you us Cisco Network Magic software, it tells you the modem is connected to the router, but it tells you you're not connected to the modem.  It makes no sense at all.

I use a standing desk that has a very small area for the mouse.  Most mouses I've tried never could make it from display corner to corner without picking it the most and repositioning it.  The MS 6000 was the first mouse I used that would make it from corner to corner easily.  I had hopes that the magic mouse would end that problem and give me all the other neat functions.  Unfortunately, the mouse barely made it forcing me to lift an reposition often.  I also found the magic mouse seemed to have too much drag on the surface.  It almost felt sticky.  The nail in the coffin was when the mouse dropped from the standing desk to concrete (40 inches) breaking the ability to right click.  My MS6000 is dropped at least once every few weeks and it lasted almost two years.  Needless to say, I ordered another MS 6000, and am once again happy."

4424826,0.0,"Awful. Threw them in a drawer after the first few tries and they haven't come out since.

There's an uncomfortable pressure while wearing them. I don't consider myself an audiophile, but even so, the sound quality is pretty unimpressive. And the mic is an absolute piece of junk. Originally had planned to use it for Skyping and online gaming, but that didn't happen. Was told there was a lot of static in the background of the call and my voice could barely be heard. Just absolutely awful.

The frosting on the cake was that somehow by installing these, I messed up Windows' sound settings. Originally pairing them, they were not detected as headphones/mic. I got that fixed, realized how bad they were, then never used them again. But applications suddenly stopped switching between speakers and plugged in headphones. I would put on my usb headset and games continued to play through speakers or not at all. The feedback it created playing online was a pain. It's been a few months now though, and I *think* I've gotten the software issues mostly resolved. Still, Skype acts like its paired when its not, headphone volume is still missing from volume icon in taskbar, and a few other oddities that didn't exist prior to owning these persist.

So to summarize: They hurt to wear. They hurt others who have to listen to you using them. And they continue to cause problems even once you've locked them away. But ya know, at least the bluetooth function actually worked!"

It takes pictures easily and does all the thinking / adjusting for you. Simply set it on one of the two auto settings and snap pictures to your hearts content.

I recently went to the San Francisco Zoo in California USA and took pictures from open to close. Thats 10:00 am to 5:00 pm. The cameras batteries did die, but only after the entire day was done. Just around 4:30 they died and I was already done with taking picture at that point. Basically the battery life is great and just what you might expect from a Lithium Ion battery. I brought a back up with me (bought separately) but never needed it.

The zoom is great and gets closer than I've experienced with cameras of this type.

The buttons are a bit close together and sometimes you hit buttons you never meant to but honestly that does not bother me all that much.

Overall I simply adore this camera. I even bought the proprietary case for it. If your looking for a camera to support your hobby of taking photographs then this is the one for you. Just don't drop it because the smaller and thinner they are the more fragile they are."

I have tried several 2-port KVM switches and the pros for this are definitely:
  * keyboard, mouse and tablet all respond properly when switched back and forth (no need to remove and re-plug)
  * an LED gives visual feedback when the switch flips over (which is great when you accidentally double-click the switch)
  * integrated cables.

The only downside is that it is VGA, not DVI or HDMI, which means it is close to being obsolete video-wise."

306251,1.0,"The ""Clean Dr"" duster is compact and gentle.  That is actually a very good combination for cleaning cameras, cleaning the lens of CD/DVD player, and other delicate mechanisms.  If you want to blow heavy accumulations of dust out of a computer, then you need a powerful ""canned air""-type duster.

The pressure of most ""canned air"" dusters is potentially damaging, and difficult to control.  Moreover the rapid temperature change caused by a high volume of very cold gas might damage some components.  Some even even spray out a liquid (if you hold the can anyway other than perfectly vertically), which although it evaporates quickly, I worry may damage front surface mirrors or electronic image sensors.

Similarly, I find that the high velocity of ""canned air"" blows dust INTO my scanner though tiny gaps.  With a Clean Dr duster, I can blow dust off the glass without blowing it into the scanner.  The compactness of the tiny sexy CleanDr is obviously an advantage in mobile applications---such as in your camera bag.

In conclusion, compact C02 dusters are great tools when used appropriately.  The problem is the misleading advertizing which claims that these are more powerful than ""canned air.""

The monitor rests stable on the desk, and the round stand base is great for collecting coins, paperclips, etc. The monitor + stand is super thin and doesn't eat up very much footprint on your desk at all.

1903819,1.0,"As a professional AV installer, I have had a lot issues with substandard HDMI cables which don't work properly with the resolutions they are supposed to support. For a long while, my go-to company to use was BlueJeans cable, and whilst they are still available, I really like these Mediabridge cables (with the green stripe specifically) for the thin-ness and hence flexibility of the cable, and the fact that they work without issue at 1080p resolution, from an Apple TV for example.

I have NOT tested them at 4K as I don't have any material capable of working at 4K, and I don't have a display at home that is 4K capable yet (both mine are 1080p capable).

There was no problem in achieving a balanced sound. I did it first by ear then with a sound pressure level meter. On test tone, I had the center a little louder by ear and decreased its level to match L & R fronts by the sound pressure level meter. The front sound stage feels balanced and the dialogue is nice and clear."
1319573,1.0,So let me paint a picture for you so you can understand what I did with this cable. I have a mini wireless keyboard connected to my television. This keyboard would connect then disconnect over and over again. I used this cable to move the receiver for the keyboard to another location to improve performance. It works great now. I have used Amazon Basics products before and have really liked them so far. I didn't know they made cables until I went looking for this one. The cable is very well made. Any other cables I need from now on I will be checking to see what Amazon Basics has to offer first. I will continue to recommend Amazon Basics products to everyone I know. Why spend more when you can get the same or better for cheaper. Nice job Amazon!

1834568,0.0,"When my original router crapped out, I needed a replacement in a hurry, and this was basically what was available in the big box store (you can't exactly order a router over Amazon or check reviews when you have no connectivity!)

It set up ok and seemed to work fine, but when the power goes out it glitches in a nasty way:  it takes you back to the screen to set a router password, which you must do before it will reconnect to the internet, and that screen loops when  you press NEXT ... you can't get beyond it without resetting the router. Of course then after you reset the router, you have to reconfigure it.  Nothing like an hour of work to recover from a 10 second power glitch. Every single time!

There are also bugs in the ""pinhole"" management, which is this router's term for port forwarding.  If you add and delete too many times (and I have a bunch of IP cameras), the database gets corrupted and you can't add or delete any more and you have to reset.

I checked on Motorola's website and as of this writing I am on the current level of the firmware, so no fix is available for these problems.  If you google on ""2247-n8 password loop""  you'll find lots of other people with this problem.

At about 4m or 13 Feet that's not a problem any more. It is actually 200mm unlike the vr-2 version which only goes as far as 135mm on FX. You need steady hands in low shutter speeds, or a monopod. I use it mostly for portraits, and it is increadible, in studio is really neat, and on environmental portraits gives a really good compression and an awesome bokeh.

Also please note that anyone within a few feet of you can hear your tunes because you have to turn your iPod up to full volume to even hear anything with these because they stand out from your ears so much.

3549717,1.0,"This tablet is GREAT! It is my first venture into a tablet; so, I had quite a learning curve. As a lifelong Windows user and hobbyist, there are quite a few differences between Windows and Android. Windows gives you more granular control over the device. The idea that an App is going to demand access to so much privacy data is scary. Also, security and privacy Apps do not seems to be a priority in the Android world. You must search for them. I was able to install and implement a VPN (virtual private network) on the tablet ensuring encryption of internet communication and a phony IP address to fool location tracking. It works great on the tablet. I also love the simple ability to turn the WiFi on and off anytime.

The clarity of the screen and the ability to change the brightness are SUPERB! I installed BitDefender for anti-malware. I just wish that the Apps or the tablet provided more on operations. I feel as though I am hunting for function in the dark. For the price, I can't imagine doing better. The tablet is sturdy/substantial; it gives me the feel of something that is not going to fall apart. The popup keyboard is the right size for my large hands. I can sit and read documents and books more comfortably than sitting at a computer screen. Asus did a great job! I would recommend it to anyone."
3829734,1.0,"Mine arrived broken. Nothing to do with the product, just a shipping problem I believe. Glass was shattered. I bought it on Amazon to save the extra $50 my local store wanted. I couldn't wait for a second to arrive so bit the bullet and paid the extra $50. Well worth it. I'm the type to research for hours before I settle on an item, and this monitor got great reviews by people I trust in. Once again I was not disappointed by their recommendations and would recommend this monitor myself. As all the reviews said, the blacks are not great, but definitely worth the slight setback for the price, compared with higher end monitors. As far as I'm concerned, it does JUST as well as monitors that cost double the price."

2899422,0.0,"I've had this item for about a week. So far I've had two problems with it.

First, frequently the mouse doesn't communicate well with the receiver, even though it is only about 14 inches away from it. I am fairly certain that it is a reception issue, since it works fine when I move the mouse closer to the receiver. This problem is intermittent.

Secondly, the scroller has stopped working twice. To fix this, I had to turn it off and back on again.

Update: I am lowering my rating from two stars to one star. I contacted Microsoft this evening to see if they could help with the reception issue, and they said they don't offer support for hardware problems. They said to try returning it to the place where I bought it, and if that doesn't work out, to call them back. If I end up getting a refund or a working mouse, I'll plan to come back and update my review."

820057,1.0,We bought this little gem at LOWE's over 7 years ago when we lived in an older home. It worked great then and it works great now in our new home. We do have a larger yard and many darker spots so we went back to LOWE's hoping to find it again and were very disappointed that it was no longer a item they sold. Much to our surprise while looking for security cameras on Amazon we found it and instantly bought it. During daylight hours the color is brilliant and you can see very well but at night do not expect to read a license plate from 30 feet in the dark and yes it does get a bit grainy but we also have it  in paired with security lights and when they come on it has a very good black and white picture within 20 feet and the closer the object the better you can see it. It is under the eaves but it has faced some pretty harsh weather and it still works very well and yes it is the old camera I'm talking about so I don't expect any less from the new one. We are not disappointed in it and will probably get one for my daughter who lives alone. You do however have to get your own monitor. We have it hooked to an old 13 in color tv and it works great. The tv does have a combo VCR recorder and DVD player so if you want to record for at least 8 hrs and have the old stand by VHS tapes it does very well the picture come out very clear and I guess that too would depend on how good your tape is. We will buy it again

5307393,1.0,"I liked this so much for my monopod that I bought another one for my travel tripod! Well built and solid. I carry some really heavy gear and noticed that unless the large knob is not very tight, my 5D MKIII and 100-400 MKII has a tendency to move when the tripod/monopod is carried over my shoulder but that is a LOT of weight and other ballheads would probably do the same. Tightening the knob very tight fixes the problem. Other than that, it is very smooth and it even comes with an Arca-Swiss plate which is also very well made. It is only $20 more than the lighter model (IB1) and I bought that one first but returned it because for $20 more, this one is much more heavy duty than the IB1 and worth the extra bucks."

905113,0.0,"I settled for these headphones, which I bought at Rite Aid for $15 because of the flashy packaging and a seemingly natural design. I couldn't be more disappointed. The speakers have this rubber balloon thing on them, which is apparently intended to enhance bass. But it feels like someone is shoving a pen in your ears. I can't wear them for more than about 10 minutes before the pain is unbearable. The bass is mediocre and they get pretty loud, but you'll need a high pain threshold because these are very irritating. Also, where the chord splits is almost directly under your chin and you can't split the cord yourself. All I wanted was a decent replacement for my Sony MDR-W08 headphones which have been discontinued (who knows why), but so far I can't find heaphones to match them. Philips disappoints me once again."

I generally use my boat every weekend I get a chance, most in sun but if I'm fishing I stick it out in the rain unless there's a monsoon going on, then I head in.  Have been out with this particular unit maybe 30-40 times in the two years in hot/cold, wet/dry weather.

So far it has held up great.  No problems, no fading, still works after two years.  It's easy to use, contains plenty of information about the fish and landscape below your boat. I would highly recommend it, certainly a bargin at the price I paid for it here. 5 stars."
1884029,1.0,"This model is not the latest Sony BD at this point, but I am very happy I purchased the S380, it does it all well and the price is right at this time.

I have larger collection of regular widescreen DVDs and wanted to be sure the player would up-sample them since I may or may not ever buy an actual Blu-Ray disc....  depends on what they remaster to BD as I don't care for too many current movies.  At least not to own and watch over and over.  The S380 makes all my DVDs look so much better, they all come off looking like HD quality.
Even improves the old 4:3 format B&W films to a fresh face.

I didn't really care that it came WiFi ready, (use cord or WiFi adapter for wireless) but did plug it into my router and now find many fun and educational videos to watch on the Internet... some great Internet radio as well.

Comes with a feature filled remote also, lots of control.  Including drawer open/close for those that require it.

I'm not finding anything to gripe about after about two months of ownership."

I was never sure when typing how many times each letter was going to appear when I hit the key, maybe once, maybe twice, sometimes 3 times.

2421835,0.0,"Corsair's Business Strategy: Make it a hard, expensive, and long process to discourage returns.

Never have I had a failed RAM in my life. First one is this, from Corsair. Sure they offer a lifetime warranty. Sure I can RMA. But what would it take? Weeks without a working computer? And you pay for shipping? Majority of people will just buy a new RAM because they need it ASAP, and never bother with RMA.

I don't know what it is, but I have always had bad luck with Corsair products. Everything is mediocre at a high price point - probably because of their marketing, with media like Linus and friends. (I have nothing against LinusTechTips, but one thing I would not believe them is when they tell me how great Corsair is, because he is paid to do so). I have returned false advertised keyboard, mice gathering dust, a peeling mouse pad, cpu cooler messing with BIOS, case that won't accommodate non-corsair fans. Perhaps the only product that I have worth praising is their speaker (SP2500).

6248920,0.0,"I purchased this for two WD 500GB drives to have a mirrored USB backup drive after my Seagate FreeAgent 750GB failed costing me an arm and a leg to recover the data.

I decided to get a mirrored system for all my important data.

The instruction is not that good.  I had to search manufacturer's web site for answers.  The 2nd drive's light started to blink red/green.  I found out from their site that I need to install the software to build the 2nd mirrored drive.

The yellow latches / covers for the drives feel flimsy and weak.  Doesn't feel very study with the drives inside, so don't drop it.  It gets really hot if you don't stand up the enclosure with the enclosed holder.

So far, it is working!  I will have to test how a failure will work before I will trust to copy all my data onto it.

Here's what I did.  I put the drives in, plug it to USB, set the jumpers, press the black button one time, wait for your PC to detect the new configuration, you can see this in Disk Management, install SiliconImage from CD, reboot PC, connect this drive to USB, run software to see drive, rebuild drive 1 for mirror, took 3 hours for 500gb.

Update: The 2nd drive would fail on the mirror almost every time I plug it in (USB).  The drive wants to rebuild the mirror.  Tech support told me to check chipset on motherboard.  ""For external use it is only support by Nvidia chipets 680i, 780i and 790i."""

Almost threw it away. Probably like many others as I had no easy way to test the adapter. You can't just plug one adapter in to something else. Especially due to the odd sized plug designed by D-Link. Intentional? You tell me? Tested it with a volt meter. Dead.

So, I looked on line to buy one and guess what? No one sells a 1.2mm x 2.2mm sized (or what ever stupid size it is) power adapter. They made these small, I can only guess, because it is a possible revenue generator?

New ones are ~$15. And they will too likely die a short death as well. In fact, I have never had a Power Adapter die before my actual product before.

So now, I will buy a - / + 12v 2.5amp or 3amp power adapter or brick and splice this stupid sized end on it.

D-Links only recourse is to buy a new power adapter. Nearly impossible to find one of this end size...unless you buy their replacement product....

Returned through Amazon's excellent service, and was sent a replacement 2 days later (thanks, Amazon). Same problems and same troubleshooting. Now Linksys has the gall to tell me to return it to Amazon for another replacement. I told them Amazon won't and shouldn't send a 3rd replacement. They then said I should return it to them for warranty repair/replacement.

I informed them that then I would be unable to return it to Amazon. I suggested that they send me a unit at their expense, and if it worked I would pay them the price I paid Amazon. They seemed to think my proposition was unreasonable.

I've set the WAN up as a failover (not load-balancing) as I don't have a duel Internet connection, with WAN1 port being the primary.

I have updated the firmware to no avail.

I've bumped  thoroughput settings up to 1 million K each way and MTU is set at 1,500 (factory default).

I've got a couple hours of trying to troubleshoot this thing and  every time I look at the ""easy set up wizard"" it just pisses me off.  Which I have run the wizard more than once and reset it to factory defaults all to no avail. BTW, I hate wizards and avoid them at all cost.

But there are still so many CDs and DVDs that I need to view and was thrilled to find this external optical drive which works great and is small and ight enough to put in the laptop bag to carry with you.

Can't boot eMMC and use SD without jumping through hoops (need SD in as well to boot at all). Needs heat sink and even with the heat sink can not achieve advertised speed without putting a barrel connector on it and fan. Poor community support. Save your money and aim for a Raspberry Pi 3 or Orange Pi Plus 2e (not on Amazon unfortunately).

I would say do not purchase this board. The one for sale here does not have the barrel connector for power so you are limited to ~9W. With cooling attached you will exceed this and it will result in hangs (total freeze) when the SoC is undervolted. Newer models replaced the USB power with a barrel connector which can reach 3A. You can read more at:

[...]

If you want a stronger board and still need the gbit ethernet.... Look at the Orange Pi Plus 2e (That model exactly... there is another one with a similar name but if it is sold as anything but the Orange Pi Plus 2e then avoid it as well). If the gbit isn't important then go with a Raspberry Pi 3. Both of these boards have far better support and are better engineered than this one.

Also: VERY OVERPRICED FOR WHAT YOU GET. It's a ripoff."

What seemed to be a great idea turns out to be little more than an adapter with an *extra card storage slot"" - IF you're lucky.

Virtually everyone who manufactures/sells these warns buyers about the potential for data corruption. And they DO NOT LIE.

Aside of repeated problems with my computer and/or PSP2001 repeatedly failing to recognize SOME OR ALL OF THESE CARDS (I got TWO adapters. SAME PROBLEMS with BOTH...) even when they finally WERE recognized, repeated data corruption immediately reared its ugly head. Checking the two SanDisk 8GB CLASS 2 cards individually, everything worked fine. I also tried them with two Sandisk 8GB CLASS 6 cards. ONLY when they were combined in the adapters did the problems surface. Switching the two between the ""A"" and ""B"" slots had absolutely no effect on the problems. I began considering that after buying these adapters, I would have actually been ahead just to invest in a normal 16GB MS PRO DUO CARD...

In the end, about the only thing these are good for are to use as an extra storage slot on the card (assuming your device won't recognize it and screw up the 2nd card contents.) STEER CLEAR."

It seems like it doesn't fit into my car outlet anymore.  The only way I can get songs to come through my car speakers, with the static, is if I put a little pressure/hold the transmitter.  As soon as I take my hand off it's full blown static, very faint music.  Don't waste your money!  Unfortunately I did not save the packaging/receipt and cannot return this item."

I do not believe this to be a defect, and obviously I've kept it pristine and dusted/clean but I cannot explain this screwed up typing vertigo the keyboard seems to exhibit.  If the RMA process wasn't so ugly and lengthily I would exchange this for one of my other Rosewills.

276544,0.0,"While the item appears to be OK, the shipping charge was excessive.  I ordered four cables at the same time from the same seller and they arrived in one envelope, yet I was charged shipping for each individual cable for a total of $11.92.  Combined shipping for all four together should have been at least half as much. The problem lies in Amazon shipping polices.  I am not happy when people achive their profits in this round-about manner.  Amazon refused my initial request to reduce the shipping charge.  Only after I submitted negative feedback to the seller on this issue did Amazon grant me a $2.98 refund on the shipping.  At the same time Amazon granted the refund, they asked me to pull down my feedback.  I am not going to do this because I want all potential buyers to know that this problem exists on Amazon."

With this adapter though I can see up to 15% packet loss on a bad night, the speed is incredibly variable anywhere to .39Mbps to the full 15Mbps we have for down speed. Oddly up speed never seems to be an issue (when testing it always seems to be at the correct value regardless of how poor the down speed is). It will randomly drop connection entirely but insist that it's still working fine (100% packet loss).

After a few weeks of struggling with it to make it work well, I scrapped it and picked up a PCIe wireless card (TP-Link N900) and haven't had a single issue since then."
2359628,1.0,Installed in minutes and works as described. Not sure why but it will only connect for a short time (30 secs to a min) once it gets power. So installer needs to use ignition voltage and not battery voltage. I am happy with it.

There is no use for the 200 male connectors with this set - only thing that makes any sense as to why they included them is to dump stock they can't sell which to me, is rather deceptive. And if you search Amazon for the female connectors alone, without the housing you'll come up with zilch.. The previous kit I purchased has a tighter fit and the correct number of connectors / housings but as most have stated, they're a pita to get crimped properly and a lot of wires end up breaking so I have even more housings I won't be able to use..."

Thumb on the outside, two fingers on the inside, that's it. New one clicks into place, just click the sides before you click down the top corners.

Comfort is something that is subjective - but I immediately found these new pads WAY more comfortable than the stock. There is more room inside for your ears. If your ears were touching the driver with the stock pads like mine do not hesitate to buy these - you'll notice a sound improvement as well (in terms of soundstage). My only complaint, like many others here is that these did not come with the Crossfade Wireless originally.

Now that my ears don't rest against the driver these headphones are less fatiguing to wear for extended periods, even with glasses."

4045525,1.0,"Works exactly as described.  If your house lines are disconnected from the telco, this Telo can act as a source for the whole house by plugging its output into any phone jack.  It does have enough power on the line to ring an old-fashioned steel bell ringer on a phone.  The security features such as blocking anonymous calls is fantastic.  I do not want a mailbox on this line so I haven't used those features.  Call clarity is just as good as Uverse Voice was.

With the cost of the Ooma, the port of the old number and purchase of a UPS to power Ooma and router a while if electricity goes down, the new system has an ROI of about 18 months vs Uverse.  After that, it's $25 in my pocket every month."

If you ignore setting the time, the system boots but is set to January 1, 2000.  If you then change the date and time, it reverts to non-set upon a reboot.  It also shows a fatal error message briefly while booting.  My theory is that whatever battery backs up the time in the bios is missing or not working.  Hence the thing is kind of useless.  It seems like quality control is a real issue on this baby.

1573476,1.0,"So, I got this yesterday.  It arrived in good condition.  I wrote all the model numbers of my devices then setup an account with Logitech and went through setup process.  You will need to know a couple things about your AV setup like what device controls the volume and what input your equipment uses to talk to the TV or projector (in my case.)  The Harmony setup website found all my devices with no problem.  I then programmed my activities like ""Watch TV"", ""Watch Movie"", etc...  After that I sync'ed the remote (downloaded the programming) and I was done.  Every activity worked perfectly on the first try.  That's what I call EASY.  My girlfriend said she wanted a remote that just had one button to watch TV and now she's got it!  Another plus, the IR is quite powerful and works even if your aim is substantially off the mark.

The only downside I've found on this remote is that they didn't backlight the buttons above the screen and those happen to be the most important buttons like ""Watch TV"", ""Watch Movie"" and the most important of all ""All Off"".  It's weird because all the other buttons have backlighting.  I'm not sure why they didn't think of that one."

As numerous others have experienced, this is not a quality made receiver. This is my first and probably last Denon experience. The receiver has had numerous bluetooth connection issues and the occasional video hiccup during it's short 7 months on this earth. Today, however, it's entirely dead.

No factory reset (which had become practically a standard start up feature for me) or any amount of unplugging seems to have worked. I had iffy luck with HDMI for the past week and now it's given up the ghost.

Bluetooth, when it connects, still functions but HDMI won't output anything audio or video.

This unit is kept in a smoke free adult home and has ample room to breathe, through completely normal usage it's just stopped working. Exactly like a huge percentage of all of these units sold.

(I later had a chance to try a second one with identical results, so it wasn't an individual defective unit, and a competing product had no trouble calibrating my monitor.)  I had a few exchanges with customer support and tried a few things they suggested which seemed to confirm that it was not working correctly and could not properly detect the screen color, but it always took a couple tries to get a response from them.  Then they quit answering my emails at all.  At the last minute (as in a couple days before the return period ended, and about a month after I had first contacted them) they said they were sending a replacement, but they sent the wrong thing.  It was all a quite disappointing waste of my time, and based on the customer support experience alone I'm unlikely to buy another one of their products."

3228587,0.0,"I bought this TV to replace a smaller bedroom tv. I was no longer able to read the print on my 22"" and upgraded to this 40"".

Upon arrival, I set up the tv and hooked it up to my Apple TV. That is the only accessory I have hooked up to this (no cable, DVD player, etc.). When I was looking at the channels on the apple tv I noticed that some of the colors were off, specifically reds/oranges/yellows. Last time I checked the NBA had not updated their logo to pink. Upon spending an incredibly frustrating half hour on the phone with TCL I have no resolution to the problem. I have determined the problem to be a problem with the left third or so of the TV. In the first picture posted here of the blue screen you can see a line on the left side. To the left of that there are oscillating bars on that part of the screen. The second and third picture is two channels, one while placed on the right side of the apple tv menu and the other on the left side. There is clearly a change in color from one side to the other.

TCL customer service tried to convince me that this tv is not compatible with the apple tv and that they don't troubleshoot apple tvs. The tv is only acting as a monitor so this absurd. Basically they tried to get me to try other peripherals and I even hooked my apple tv unit up to my second tv to assure them that the problem does not lie within the apple tv.

Basically, if the tv works for you, great. If not, you will have a horrible time dealing with their customer service."

LAST BUT NOT LEAST, the included screws and nuts are incorrect, as the nuts have stoppers and the screws are way too long.

In my case, video quality with the GoPro Hero 3+ is far superior *WITHOUT* this thing. For instance, on ascents, with this vibration dampener installed, it, paradoxically, vibrates all over the place. Using only the stock mount, things are fine and smooth as silk.

Got these because of Wasabi excellent reputation and my personal experience with the brand. Price was unbeatable too....

Problem is very simple. With the plastic wrappers around the battery case (not shown in product photos), these batteries are JUST slightly wider then the Canon original.

With my SL1, it was very tight sliding in and the plastic wrapper on the case was getting wrinkled.

Also, for some strange reason, the included Wasabi charger charged both Wasabi batteries fine, but the Canon charger refused to charge the Wasabi, but worked perfectly with the OEM Canon.

I hooked up this cable and got ""no signal"" so I tried another bluray player, same issue, so I tried the dish hopper and got:  ""HDCP Error (long message)"" - so I reset the hopper, same message.  So, I pulled the amazon basics 25 foot HDMI cable off my other setup and plugged it in, in place of this one, and it synced and I had picture.  Both bluray players also worked. I'm only guessing the bluray players don't display anything if there is a HDCP error (High Definition Content Protection).
So..... I just paid 4 bucks more and got another Amazon Basics cable, because I know it works (at least).

AMENDED:
I've decided to keep this cable - it works well for my laptop output, and saves me 2 days of ordering another cable.  I amended this only to cover the return, I still do NOT recommended this cable for much other than a a cheap 'goat lasso' or some such."

I am waiting to buy a second Netgear to supplement WiFi dead zones I have as a result. BTW - for some reason Amazon did not post my negative long term review of the TP-LINK TL-WA901ND for some reason?

As the others have stated, setup is most definitely more difficult than it needs to be as this device comes out of the box with a static IP address to reach the admin interface. This is kind of crazy since the firmware that is on the box supports DHCP, just that DHCP is not selected as the default. Also the WiFi are set as wide open by default as the other reviewers stated. NetGear needs to put in a bit of work on the setup, or maybe not hire High School Interns as product developers.

The value and performance of the product seems very good once setup. I will have to wait and see if this product dies, just like the TP-LINK TL-WA901ND did just after the warrrenty expired as some other reviewers stated. I would have given this product a 5-star review except for the unnecessarily difficult setup. Only Access Point I could find for under $100 with both 2.4 and 5 GZ. It is nice that you have the option to make both SSIDs the same.

When purchasing something on Amazon, it's almost impossible to find something with purely positive reviews. Because of this, we have to take the one with the least negative reviews or the ones that seem to have most good quality control. Unfortunately, when purchasing this item, I ignored all the reviews about how fragile this fan is. As someone who takes very good care of all of my things, I thought it would be easy to avoid breaking a fan, regardless of how fragile. I've had this for a few months and it has been fine. Truth be told, it's hard to tell if this fan is even on. It's barely moves any air at all, but after spending the money I figured I'd rather use it than return it. Today, when moving a few things around on my desk, this fan fell over. It was a gentle fall as the rubber bumpers on the corners prevents a rough landing. But despite the fact that this fall of a couple inches was silent and gentle, one of the fan blades snapped off at the base. This was fun to discover when plugging the fan back in as the broken blade spun around like crazy, proceeding to break other fan blades. I'd steer clear of this and find just about any alternative."

Long version - I unpackaged the item and my first opinion was that it felt very cheap.  I started looking at the directions and my next thought was the directions were more worthless than the item felt cheap.  I put the disk in my computer and waited for it to auto run like the directions said it would.  It did not and I know this is not an issue with my computer because everything else I put in the drive auto runs.  I started clicking the links on the CD to follow the directions in case auto run did not work.  I quickly found that the directions do not match what is on the disk at all, and don't give you any indication of what to actually do if auto run does not work.

The difference between the two is like night and day.  This unit takes 5-10 minutes to do a channel scan.  The Channel Master takes about 45 seconds.  The Channel Master picks up at least 30% more stations than the Tivax and has a better remote, a better menu system and a better guide.  The picture of the Tivax is pretty good on the few stations that come in strong enough to not be pixelated, but overall I think it is a lousy product.

As with everything I review, I use an item for several months to truly evaluate how good it is after the ""new"" purchase feeling has died down and I want to evaluate performance and not emotions for my new toy.

This camera is simple to review.  It is very well made.  It is a good looking camera.  You expect big things. But...

What you get it is horrible images.  I used it all through the Christmas and New Year holidays (2008) and was disappointed in its pictures.  If this is your first camera in this arena you might not be able to tell and think the images look fine, maybe even great.  However, owning several high end DSLR's, and having used several ""point and shoots"" as quick grab backups, I can say the images aren't good. They are grainy.  The colors are poor and muted in many instances.  Low light pictures are terrible, bordering on horrendous.  This camera is nowhere near as sharp as my Canon SD900 was and makes me even sadder I lost it.  In the end, aren't the pictures what the camera is all about regardless of the nice construction?  My experience was such that I returned this camera and got a new Canon SD1100 IS which performs as I expect a point and shoot to perform.  Not perfect, but great images for what you are using it for.

Pros: Well built with nice construction.  Decent battery life.  Good looking camera.

Cons: POOR IMAGES."

5180485,0.0,"I've had this receiver for only two months and have had nothing but problems with it. When I first received it, I couldn't get the AccuEQ microphone to calibrate the sound levels. The receiver simply didn't detect any input from the microphone, or any microphone. I still never resolved that, and simply manually adjusted the settings. I then had a constant problem where the receiver was constantly playing audio from the wrong source. After some fiddling this turned out to be caused from HDMI-CEC, after disabling that problem went away. Most recently whenever I turn on the receiver it results in a constant humming sound from all speakers, regardless of the volume level, for several minutes, and will continue to hum for up to 30 minutes until it just randomly stops. I've tried everything I could think of, purchased a power cleaner, unplugged all the extra devices, rewired the speakers, and nothing prevents the humming and nothing I do consistently stops it, it always just randomly cuts out.

This is extremely frustrating to me, because I've only ever bought Onkyo receivers, they've always been such great quality in the past. This experience has completely turned me off though, and I'm looking to get rid of this defective and useless unit and replace it with something that actually works."

I have no explanation for this as other enclosures power the hard drive just fine.

Pros:
-10ft in length (great for a desk or night stand so you are not limited to one side of the bed)
-Apple Certified meaning that no errors will come up when using this cable on any iOS version
-Thick and durable cable
-Black in color
-USB end has good strain relief
-Lightning end is not oversized (not the same size as Apples lightning cable)
-Works great with charging my iPhone 5, iPod touch 5 and iPad Air
-Good price for a 10ft Apple Certified cable!

Cons:
-Lightning end has no strain relief meaning that if the cable gets rested in the part and it is done many times over time, it can expose the wires inside (take care of the cable)

I recommend this lightning cable.

In the single case my HDD's kept failing, I'm assuming from heat. In this case I've had none of those problems after several months (and this is with the resurrected drives). This case includes a very small fan. I was worried it was too small but the worry was unfounded. The fan is very quiet, which is nice. There are only two very minor issues. One is that the blue light on the front is way too bright. This seems to be a common problem on any computer hardware I have with a blue light, though I'm not sure why. I'm sure it could be disconnected or covered up. The second is that the largest drives you can put into them are 1TB each. No problem so long as your drives are not over 1TB and they state this in the description very clearly. Though not a problem, and actually I like this, when you install the drives they will appear as one drive on the system (thus the RAID designation). As far as I can tell there is no way to have them show up separately. This is just fine with me but I thought it may be worth mentioning."

We use to joke saying that airlines should encase their ""blackboxes"" in a Leaspter because they were so durable.  Well that impressive quality ended with the Leapster Explorer and LeapPad.

Specifically, we purchased 2 Leaspter Explorers and both broke in less than a year (no volume/sound)... LeapFrog replaced them and each of the replacements lost sound within 18 months.  We also bought 1 charger and it had to be replaced twice in 1 year by LeapFrog since it wouldn't charge.  Unacceptable at this price point.

Shockingly, we purchased a LeapPad and it, too, had volume/sound issues (can only hear the sound with headphones just like with Explorer).  LeapFrog replaced it and sure enough that one lost sound in a year, as well.

Interesting, the original silver Leapster which is about 11 years old is still working... too bad they don't sell that one anymore.

I searched the Internet and this seems to be a common problem.

I warn all my new mommy friends now to not buy a LeapPad or Leapster... simply get a Mini iPad and encase it in an Otterbox for solid, reliable durability... and enjoy all the other advantages of having an iPad (email, web surfing, etc)."

.
Pros:
It's small
It's light
It can hold a lot of music

Cons:
The software is buggy and nearly impossible to use (this may be a Mac compatibility problem; it sounds like PC users have had fewer issues.)
My music won't sync, any time I have new items in iTunes, this device won't pick them up no matter how many times it scans my folders.  Drag-n-drop never work for me either.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software, only to discover that Coby has closed its doors and there are no updates to be had.

Even when it does play, the earbuds aren't great.  You have to turn the volume up to ridiculous levels to be able to hear your music over any ambient noise; the only place I was ever able to hear what I was playing was in my apartment (and given the whole point of my purchase was to enjoy audio in places I couldn't/didn't want to take my computer (e.g. the gym,) I didn't have much use for it and now I have a $30 paperweight.)

So if you've A) Already got some really great noise canceling headphones, B) Work on a PC, C) Don't mind that if ANYTHING goes wrong with this thing you're dead in the water since Coby doesn't exist anymore...  Then sure, go for it.

Some workarounds are simple like reinstalling intel GPU drivers, others require you to update the processor's microcode by installing a modified BIOS. These workarounds may or may not fix the issue.

The ""on"" light would sometimes be on, sometimes not, and the cursor would not move at all on the screen.  So I opened the other one and it worked.  However, in only a couple days of using it, the on light is again intermittent.  Also a smaller on/off switch, harder to see, find, on the bottom.

Supposedly, the unit had been checked out by JVC quality control technicians, problems remedied, and then put back on the market for sale at a lower than retail price.  The first unit I recieved...half of the jacks didn't work...HDMI, digital jacks...only RCA jacks worked.  So I sent it back for a new unit.  I will say the sound was good from the RCA jacks and the unit has lots of power....that is the only reason I would give it 1 star...otherwise I would give it none.  The second unit I received would not move off of the Auxilary setting...in other words, you couldn't use the Tuner, CD, DVD, etc settings...so I sent it back one more time.  3rd unit was shipped and I waited for the UPS guy like a kid at Christmas waiting for the perfect gift (what was I thinking?).  The 3rd unit wouldnt even power up.  3 units and none of them operated properly...I cant say for sure who JVC has working quality control at their factory, but I am beginning to believe it might be they guys from the movie ""Dude, where's my car?"".  From what I have read elsewhere, it isn't just the refurbed 401 units that have issues...the new ones have had bad reviews as well.  I don't often give a bad review, but this unit was a total headache for me.

The input and output volumes are adjustable through the computer's settings feature.  The volume in the headset is also adjustable on the left earphone except when I'm using Google Voice.

Excellent product.  Electrician's insurance paid for the rest.

3959453,1.0,"Have had this video card for a couple of years now and it has yet to disappoint me. While this card comes at a fair price and can be seen as an entry level graphics card, do not be fooled. Like the other reviewers have said, this card can stand up to many of the popular games being played today. While this card is not capable of running every new game on Ultra 4k resolution, you can still find a healthy balance while being able to play all of the games that you want to play. This card was very easy to install, it is a normal size card and can be popped right into your mobo, there is no need to remove any brackets or clear out any extra space. Everything will fit like normal. The card is powerful so it does require a 4 pin plugin to power it up. No big deal and should be included on any power supply. This card operates very well under an intense load, while it does get noisier with the higher work load, the fan does a very nice job on getting the heat our. If you can handle a little noise increase,then this card is great for all your gaming needs. I have never experienced the card overheating or turning off my machine. As other reviewers have said, you can try speedfan or modifying the Bios, but I have yet to experience any issues. Radeon did a great job with this card and still offers updates every now and then, which is great especially since its starting to become an older card."
6641225,0.0,"I was using this to output audio over displayport to my non-HDMI 2.0 compliant home theater receiver, while putting out 4k video straight to my LG TV from my NVIDIA GTX-950's HDMI port.  It worked fine with minor quirks for 6 months or so until tonight when suddenly it stopped outputting audio.  I thought it was a driver issue until I unplugged and replugged it in and suddenly now it won't output video either.

I ended up having to buy one of the newer active Displayport to HDMI 2.0a adapters and live with only stereo output over TOSlink and the ARC compliant HDMI port on the TV for two days until it arrived."
1290321,1.0,"I do presentations and training.  This little laptop fits every where and is easy to setup.  What I like best is the battery life.  If I can not reach a power plug it will run for six hours if I am running my scanner off of it and the DVD drive.  If the computer is all I am using it will run 8 to 9 hours depending on usage.

This helps a lot when I am traveling on airplanes.  I do not have to hunt around for an outlet so I can work on reports or decide to play a game while I wait through another airline delay.

Highly recommended for travelers.

I have had this for four months."

4909258,1.0,"I have yet to use a bad camera made by Canon. The Powershot SX530 looks like a hybrid between a Point and Shoot and a DSLR. The image quality is great, and the camera is very light and portable. I shoot mainly with DSLRs, but I have been a fan of Canons Point and Shoot cameras for years, and I have a few of them, including the Powershot SX530. The Powershot SX530 has a 50X zoom capability, which is great, but if you're going to zoom out that far, make sure you use a tripod. The image quality is very good, and the color is pretty accurate. The cameras greatest feature, in my opinion, is that it can be set to Manual mode. Some of the Canon Point and Shoots only have Program mode, which allows you to set only the ISO, but this camera lets you set the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. So if you are used to shooting in Manual mode with a DSLR, youll be happy to know that you can do the same thing with this camera.
This is a great camera for anyone."

692741,0.0,"Purchased this product and it failed to work due to internal power failure (as per seagate).  In order to fix they require that I pay for shipping the product back to them - case #900690. This is standard seagate warranty policy, according to the warranty service supervisor.  My advice:  take note of any negative comments from other consumers on any and all seagate hardrives - and then do not purchase that product line from anywhere unless its so cheap it is worth the risk and aggravation if it fails - for Seagate expects you to share the cost burden to correct their own errors.  I guess they consider it a privilege for us to use their products.  NOPE . . . .  I consider it a privelege to chose not to use their products . . I'll now pay more if I have to to avoid purchasing any Seagate products.  I purchase from companies who seem to me that they understand what it means when someone choses to purchase their products.

3043444,0.0,"SEE BELOW FOR EDITED REVIEW.
Requested and got these for Xmas 2013.  I've tried three other brands of video eye-wear in the last three months or so.  These are the first ones I'll keep.  Better picture quality, camera angle, ease & convenience of operation, computer interface, date & time stamping, and comfort.  They're not perfect, but for a little pinhole camera mounted on glasses, they're very good.  This is not a wide-angle lens.  There is no fish-eye.  Another reviewer complained that the camera was aimed too high, but mine isn't.

If you've never tried any other video eye-wear product, you might not be that impressed; but they're far better than the other three I've tried, which were priced between $80 & $300.  Only question mark is durability & longevity.

Edit Aug 19, 2014.  Battery won't take a charge.  Have only used them for a total of about 5 hours or so.  Only a 90 day warranty.  I'm screwed."

I pointed out that the rebate is still advertised on the Amazon page, but the Asus ""customer service"" rep basically said ""tough, take it up with Amazon"".  So I opened a chat session with Amazon and spoke to a very nice lady.  She passed the case to her leader, and offered me a $5 promotional coupon for my inconvenience, and said that they would call me later to let me know the story on my rebate.  When I didn't receive a call, I opened another chat and spoke to another lady.  She offered me another $5 coupon, but said that I need to pursue Asus over the rebate.  I rang Asus again, at 18:15 EST, to be told that they are closed.  So they close at 3pm West Coast time - that is really fantastic customer service.  And now I'm left in no-man's land between these two large companies.

There is not a whole lot to say about the Hot shoe adapters other than they work.

I have to remove the entire case to fit on the Griffin charger (also have to remove the iPhone's case to charge).  The first time it took nearly 20 minutes to remove the top piece of the cover.  I was scared the whole time I might damage the iPad because the piece would not slide up and I had to actually pry it up.  Once I got the top half pried off it took several minutes to work the iPad out the the main part. The second time it took nearly 25 minutes to pry the top piece of the cover off.  Cut my hand three different times on the tabs on the cover and ripped a finger nail half off.  The cover makes a great way to protect the iPad but is too tight of a fit to remove easily like the iPhone one does.  Sending back ASAP.  I am not risking damaging my iPad trying to remove this cover.  So disappointed in it.

1009656,1.0,"I'm always shocked when I go to local stores and still see this radio on the shelves.  There's a reason for that.  I bought mine well over 5 years ago and it's still the absolute best portable radio I've ever used.  Digital tuning with presets, a surprisingly effective AM antenna, great sound, weather band, a battery indicator, it's really well-equipped.  Over all these years, there's only one feature it lacks that would make me buy another:  A light.  If you're using it at night, it can be a bit tricky to see the display.

Honestly, that's the only complaint I've had over all these years.  Anything else is common of all portable radios, such as minor interference near computers, etc.

The TN panel is definitely not an IPS, so it's kind of washed out and overly bright. If I could return it and get an IPS monitor, I would. However, it was too late once I made up my mind.

So, it's a monitor, definitely. It's washed out as all hell. It is 1920*1080 and it's a TN panel. Think long and hard before you invest in this monitor. There are IPS variants for only a bit more. I regret purchasing this monitor as the washed out colors are just terrible."

We highly recommend these.  We also considered the newer model, but we resolved that having the option of the removable cable (the only difference) wasn't worth the higher price-tag (one more item to lose).

First of all the Bottle Mini has great sound, I would say it rivals products that are a hundred dollars more. It has a separate woofer speaker at the base which produces deep base for it's size. Certainly a pleasure to listen to. The overall sound volume is quite impressive and more than satisfactory for personal use.
Second, it has a long battery life, 10 hours + (as stated on the actual box packaging).
Third it is water resistant and durable so I don't have to worry about rain or sweat killing it. IP64 rating.
Lastly, it's a small portable size, although it does have a heavier weight than similar sized speakers.
It's only lacking feature is the missing mic for taking phone calls.
Easy controls on the side make volume adjustment quick."

This is a terrible laser detector, and it's my first one owned. I drove from NY to FL with this, and found Waze to be far more effective. This radar only alerted me to let me know that if I had been speeding, the cop already clocked me 5 miles ago. This radar has a 100 foot radius of effectivity. This is a good product to confirm that the cop you are already looking at is looking back at you with his radar. In addition, even with X band off, this thing detects every species of birds I believe. I am convinced that hawks register as Ka bands. You will wear out your breaks in one road trip driving with this thing. And as for the seller, Electronic Express, they wanted to charge me a fee for the return, and then denied me of any return when I told them that I just moved across the country and didn't bring the original packaging of every possession I own with me. They were rude, and had bad service. I would donate this to a friend, but I don't want to lose a friend, so now it's a useless beeping device.

1811086,0.0,"In a nutshell ... this product is one nice piece of junk! When I got it, the casing was cracked open ... straight out of the packaging. The plastic posts inside the unit that were supposed to seal it shut were cracked. The casing is made of very cheap thin frail plastic that will not last under heavy use, or even casual use I suspect. Upon arrival from shipping, I spent an hour hot gluing the darn thing sealed so I could try and make use of it. Okay, so now after some hot gluing, I'm connected to my Canon XA10 ... every time I zoom ... I get a nice loud CLICK! Zoom in ... CLICK. Zoom out ... CLICK. Piece of junk ... even for $20 ... I expect more! For some people, 20 bucks is a lot of money! It takes some people 2 hours to make 20 bucks! So if you want to record video with a bunch of clicks ... and you like repairing newly received products bought with your hard earned money ... go for it!"

Mouse tiny (mid-sized!) but decent.  Works without problem.  Feels cheap, but no problems noticed.  Connected to receiver immediately.

Keyboard is absolute crap.  Closer to receiver, but wouldn't connect until after computer reboot.  Keyboard, while sitting on desk surface, didn't work at all.  Receiver couldn't 'hear' keystrokes.  I had to take keyboard off desk & bring it to within 2 feet of receiver to get any response.  (Mouse worked just fine from farther away!)  Keys feel cheap, uncomfortable, and very noisy.

While it was working, it would not properly scale pictures that were not perfectly proportioned to the size of the screen, it would strength the images to weird distortions.  My previous digital frame could properly scale images based on the original image size or allow one to center the image, but not this unit.

1494676,1.0,"Great tool for camping, hiking, etc. Don't take it on a backcountry tour. While it's advertised as a lifesaving device, Spot has partnered with Globalstar, who don't offer a satellite network capable of 1) trusting with your life 2) covering every corner of the globe. That's not really something they can fix, that's just how they designed their satellites. There have been instances where people tried to send SOS messages and even though they were in a coverage area and satellites were in view, the signal wasn't received and deaths have occurred. If you're taking a crazy trip, invest in a proper PLB.

That said, Spot is a great product and service for messaging purposes. Realtime (every 10 minutes) tracking, and other features are great and provide peace of mind to your family. They even have an API so you can use Spot to make tracking software. It's incredible they offer their service so cheaply too, given you're talking to satellites 200 miles up."

Consumer Reports and CNET both rate these sets highly.  I personally had the opportunity to review both sets side-by-side in a local electronics store and I was sold on the Samsung due to it's price advantage and picture quality.  I was hesitant to buy a 1080p set as I only have SD dish programming and was concerned about picture quality as others have noted in their reviews.  My normal viewing distance is about 15 feet and I feel the picture quality is excellent.  If I get closer than about 8 feet however, I do notice considerable degredation of picture quality.  I have my set connected to my home theatre via the HDMI connection and it makes a big difference.  As I am not particularly a technical person, I was a little intimidated with the set up at first, but later found that set up was a breeze thanks to the intuitive nature of the menu layout.

If that piece went level, it would be a very good tripod.  However, since it does not, you have to work extra for your picture to not be crooked.

Update on 1/28/17.  This is actually a terrible product.  Not only did the horizontal part not allow it to go level but the screw part that moves the neck up and down broke after 5 or 6 uses.

232246,1.0,"I have read good and bad remarks about the 18-70 lens (mostly good, though). Maybe it's a question of whether you get a good copy or not. In any case, my 18-70 Nikon is excellent in every way: sharpness, color, contrast, distortion (obviously there is some as noted on the official review on this website, but it is entirely reasonable considering the zoom range and the price). I own a D200 and decided to run this lens through the typical battery of testing through the various focal lengths and apertures. I did not find anything whatsoever to complain about. I also own the Nikon 50 1.4 lens and at 50mm, this zoom seems every bit the equal at equivalent aperture speeds. Obviously the lens is slower and would prevent use in low-light conditions without flash or higher ISO settings (maybe VR would be cool to have). At 18mm it's a little soft until 4.5 (5.6 and slower is excellent), but only a little soft and entirely acceptable as any lens (excluding the Pro series Nikkors) tends to be soft wide open. Trust me, if your copy is as good as mine, you will be completely happy with the 18-70. I am, and I highly recommend it! (I would love to have the 18-200 VR, but who knows when I will ever see one as Nikon has told dealers 6-12 month delays, too bad: I would love to have one of these. Until then, I am happily shooting with my 18-70 on my D200 as my main lens)."

My old battery is the original so it won't hold a charge for more than 15-30 minutes, but this confirmed that the laptop is still charging and the new battery is bad.

1770933,1.0,"I use the headphones to listen to TV while my family sleeps and they work much better than other way-more expensive (Sony) wireless headphones I've tried.  These are also super light and easy to use.  I also like that I can alternately use the FM tuner to enjoy radio when not watching TV.  I just bought these again, because after almost 4 years, the padding got a bit ratty, and now the new headphones work with the old transmitter base.  Win!

To be fair, you may get interference from other devices.  I got all that and more with every other wireless headphone I've ever tried (even Bluetooth).  These headphones have a built-in digital tuner, and if they dis-tune, you can press two buttons on your right earphone to restore the tuning.  I rarely have that problem, but I live in an large apartment building, and it happens.  Tip:  To reduce staticky sound, turn up the volume on the TV and down on the headphones

The range is great for these.  I keep the headphones on and can go to any room in the apartment without problem.  Even go down the hall to take out the trash.  It's at least a good 100 foot range through walls.

The system uses AAA batteries, (2 in the transmitter/base and 2 in the headphones) and they'll last a while, but for lower costs, get some rechargeable batteries.  I find that with daily use, I recharge the batteries every week or two."
786012,1.0,"I bought this adapter (Rev. B1) because I was only getting 65 Mbps on my Acer 8930 laptop (Vista Home Premium 64 bit) with my Intel 5100 Wireless Card a/g/n via my Netgear WNR2000 N Router. Installation was simple and only took a few minutes. I discarded the CD and loaded firmware 2.2 from D-Links site. I then was prompted to insert the adapter into a USB port. After a couple of minutes, I was prompted to enter my SSID and Password. Bingo. Now I get a consistent 270 Mbps, with a very strong signal.

D-Link would like you to think that you only get the fastest wireless speeds if you use this adapter with one of their Routers. But I found that this adapter works great with my Netgear WNR2000 Router.

Sound quality? Terrible. Crackly, crunchy sound with noticeable hisses and fuzz. It's totally unacceptable when your basic iPod speaker itself is of comparable quality to this little Satechi failure's noises.

The bass, too, which is supposedly helped along by the accordion-style speaker column, is really, really underwhelming, much like the rest of the unit's features.

The buttons are on the corners of the unit-- or more appropriately, they ARE the corners of the units. Each corner/button seems to have multiple functions, like turning the volume up AND switching to the next song. With the same button. Needless to say, this leads to some musical errors that you can't avoid since you have to tap a button to do one thing, or hold the very same button to do something wildly different. HUGELY stupid idea.

Overall? Fail. Complete fail. It's cheap Chinese trash masquerading as a sleek, suave little Bluetooth unit. Instead what you get is crackly sound, button calamities, and a sense of regret. Sounds BAD all-around."

It is much more cost effective option to get little memory from Apple and then buy Crucial memory to upgrade/replace the one coming from Apple. The quality of this memory is not worse than what OEM provides. In fact after working with some Kingston and Crucial memory for years on different computers (24x7 heavy durty service)I suspect that Crucial memory may be better quality than OEM/Apple... or at least the same.

Honestly, there must be a reason why Apple decided that new low end computershave their memory soldered so you cannot upgrade.

I looked at alternatives since I was rather upset that Garmin wanted $150 to repair the old unit. I discovered the Garmin N350 at Amazon and couldn't pass up such a great deal.
Obviously skeptical, I received my unit and can't tell you how happy I am with it. It is everything that was advertised and more.

What got me mad was the label on the unit states it has a rated Let-Through Voltage of 400V(L-N), 500V(N-G and L-G).  Now, their website states Let-Through Voltage of 85V just like the PRO8T2.  I opened the unit and found two relatively small inductors.  The PRO8T2's inductors are at least three times the size.  There is no way it's 85V.

The shorter cable can be stored on the device, which is extremely handy. It does come with both lengths of cable - thanks for that!

Long story short, I have no complaints at all. The only little thing is that the surface is a little slick - I'd prefer a non-slip cover to the gorgeous blue anodized metal cover. And it is gorgeous! I get comments on it all the time. The design and appearance belies the toughness of this little beauty. Don't let this scare you off - it's just a little less ""grippy"" than I would prefer.

Pros: the only pro for me would've been the extra range, but the increased range is not even that good and I had to decrease the transmit power anyway just to keep it from rebooting multiple times per day. Now it reboots once a day or two.

Cons:
* No SSL for cli or web interface. Seriously guys? 1969 called, it wants its telnet back.
* You cannot isolate admin functions from the wireless network. That's right, their ""Admin Vlan"" only works on wireless VLANS meaning untrusted interfaces. Wireless of any encryption is pretty easy to crack. On top of the absence of SSL, this thing is terribly insecure.
* Unexpected reboots with newest firmware. If you do buy this device, DO NOT UPDATE FIRMWARE! You will get constant reboots under heavy load. Really gets frustrating when I'm on the work VPN and someone turns on Netflix and I lose my work.
* Increased range is not that much, perhaps only a few feet further than my $35 Linksys.
* Power adapter makes a screeching sound
* Wish I could put dd-wrt on this thing and get some actual useful functionality
* This one isn't a big deal to me but was VERY misleading from their literature. In order to use the fast Wireless N, you cannot use WPA encryption. You might as well open your wifi to the neighbors for free if you want Wireless N."

This unit stayed on from the time I checked in till we packed to go home. 10 weeks 24/7 it ran flawlessly. I would buy it again if I ever need two of them. I will say the cooling fan ran all the time even though it NEVER got hot(that's probably why it never got hot!!)

When it did arrive it was missing the part that connects to the computer that will allow it to work. Also, and this is IMPORTANT! never buy anything that uses small disc batteries as they are very expensive to replace. How about replcing the battery on a $5 remote with $7 batteries every month? Product description mentioned aaa batteries (included). When I contacted the manufacturer's rep regarding the missing dongle to which they agreed to send a replacement about a month ago (still waiting} they explained that the aaa model was last years and they did not update the listing.

It's not labor, just a replacement unit. Still they will charge you $30. I tried to explain that exchanging doesnt involve any labor."

Finally just gave up and bought a Roku. It works great! Will never buy another Samsung Product again.

Nope, new one is a different size and much lower quality.  The lines are different, the camera isn't straight in the housing (the camera has to be pointed to the right to see straight behind the vehicle) and it doesn't have as wide a viewing angle up and down, so I can no longer see my trailer hitch.  Also, the included drill bit is too small for the camera to fit through so it has to be hogged out a bit with sandpaper, and it has a different power connector than the old version so I couldn't do a simple swap out."
3346627,0.0,"Honestly, I would rate this portable hard drive ZERO stars if I could. I bought two of these at Office Depot.  One for a PC back up and the other a MAC.  The PC back up worked fine.  Two hours after trying to install and use it on the MAC, I have packed it back up in the box and I am returning it to the store.  I downloaded the required programs to make it MAC compatible.  I got a screen asking me how I wanted to run the back up, and then NOTHING.  It just sat there.  Making noise every once in a while, but no data was transferred.  I unplugged and replugged the unit 4 times.  Each time I did this, the unit just sat there.  Doing nothing.  No noise.  No screen asking questions.  Just silence.  I tried Disk Utility.  I tired different UBS ports on the computer.  I tried calling Toshiba tech support using the phone number I found on Amazon (given by Toshiba themselves), and was told I called the wrong number.  After being transferred THREE times, I hung up.  Their support is as bad as their product.

Then I called Office Depot.  I was told by their own product specialist that this really is not a MAC compatible product, despite the downloads they offer to try to make it work.  He suggested a Western Digital hard drive specific for MACs. Off to get one of those this afternoon.  Avoid this product like the plague if you are a MAC user.  You have been forewarned."

663574,0.0,"The Sangean PR-D5 is fine for music and song on AM or FM.  However, it's useless for news or talk on FM, and poor to average on AM.  We tend to listen to any one of three local NPR FM stations for news and talk.  All three are perfectly intelligible on other radios.

You might be familiar with older cheaper radios that had a single knob marked ""Tone"", which purportedly increased treble when turned in one direction and bass in the other.  In reality, most ""tone"" knobs went from clear (treble) to muzzy/muffled (bass).  If you're familiar with those kind of tone knobs, then you'll have an accurate concept of how FM news and talk are replicated by the Sangean PR-D5 if you imagine the tone knob were locked on the most extreme bass setting.  I say ""locked"" because the Sangean PR-D5's has no tone controls.

It's a pity.  Compared to our C. Crane CCRadio (which also has the larger 8 inch ferrite antenna), the Sangean PR-D5 is genuinely slightly better at bringing in stations.  However, that's of little comfort when it's unintelligible."

975235,1.0,"If you take lots of photos like I do, you will love this product!  I took my shoulder strap off and changed to this the first day in Italy.  I simply carried my SLR in the palm of my hand and was ever ready for a shot that I would have missed without the leather grip.  I was dubious at first because it piggybacks into the screw socket for a tripod.  I found that it interfered with nothing.  The tripod mount is duplicated into the base of the strap plastic attatchment.  I loved it.  When I set up for a tripod shot, the strap was never in the way.  This strap is handy as a pocket on a shirt.  I caught many shots I would have missed if I had relied on my shoulder strap.  My hand never tired at all which surprised me.  I used my camera bag over my shoulder and found I could rest my hand on my camera bag when I wasn't taking photos.  I was afraid my shoulder would be sore from the added weight of my hand on the bag but with the cushion on the bag strap I had no fatigue or soreness at all after a ten hour touring walk around Rome.  I had my SLR firmly encased in my hand which I am sure kept the snatch and grab thieves away from the temptation of grabbing it out of my hand.  I would recommend this to anyone.  One more thing, the strap is adjustable to fit all hands from womens to mens.  Thin hands, fat hands it will fit you.  Very functional product Sony.  Thanks."

4143025,0.0,"**2016-09-19 After receiving the replacement card (took several weeks) once it was determined it was defective, the replacement card was no better. Data loss continued and frustrated everyone involved. Replaced it with a trusty ol' SanDisk card and will never use a Samsung card (oddly in a Samsung phone). SanDisk has always performed well for me and frankly I took a chance on this card. Stay away from Samsung memory cards.

** 2016-03-01 I've not lost data a second time. It is being used on a Samsung phone. My original review/complaint was written in December so it seems to be about every three to four months that the card will lose data and need to be reformatted. The effort to reformat isn't the complaint, that's easy enough, the loss of precious pictures is. I would not recommend at all, in fact I will be submitting a warranty return submission today and will update on the ease of this process shortly. **

Now I have to disassemble this unit, package it back up, drive over to the UPS location and  return it. Then wait for the replacement to arrive and hope that the replacement unit is not also defective.

Companies should do a better job of monitoring their quality, and not ship out used items. They are just going to get returned."

However, the fact that it requires the function key to type a comma, makes it just entirely too difficult to use.  It's a key I use so frequently when typing, I just can't use this without stopping and looking down at the keyboard to find the function key every time I write a comma.  In addition to this, the keyboard regularly looses it's connection to my Galaxy Tab A.  So, I'm always backing up to add a space or a letter since I type rather quickly.  I had high hopes for this.  I don't expect I'll use it at all"
4460081,1.0,"Really great for use with USB hubs.

For some reason a lot of USB hubs have super short cords. I always hate using these USB hubs as they are not able to be placed in a good location on my desk. The extension cable gives me an extra few feet to be able to place my hubs where I need them. Now this is a USB 3.0 compatible extension cable so it will support USB 3.0 speeds but is also backwards compatible.

These are also great if you use video game controllers where an extra length would be helpful. I used this with my hardwired Xbox 360 controller and it worked flawlessly. I use hardwired controllers a lot due to the quicker response time when playing a game.

Another good use is matching this with a short charging cable that a lot of devices come with. I have a lot of external batteries to charge my phone and other portable devices with but they come with 6"" charging cables. This gives me more than enough length to be effective.

I think this is a quality built product and the price is great.

However, their warranty process is basically designed to walk you in circles until you go away.  I've now sent them dozens of pictures each time requesting something slightly different in the image.  The final two times it was requested that I put handwritten notes in the image itself!  I did so, but they keep making the same request now.  I have no choice but to sue them.

6487312,1.0,"I bought this keypad as a retrofit.  The previous owners of a house we bought had killed the security panel at one point and never fixed it. So I installed a new Honeywell panel and keypads and have been getting everything back online.  I've done all the research, so hopefully this will help some of you.  This keypad is excellent.  I didn't need all the sophistication of a touchscreen, which comes ready to integrate with Honeywell home automation equipment, so basic keypads are all I need.

I haven't ever tried to program a panel without the ""Vista Intelligent Programming"" feature, but I can say that programming the panel *with* this keypad's VIP feature was relatively straightforward.  I'm an engineer and tend to want to do things myself, and it didn't take me more than a little research and a few passes through the programming manual to figure out how to get all my zones programmed using this keypad.

I got the ""RF"" version so that I could hook up a few doors that had bad wiring.  The RF programming was straight-forward and the signal reaches everywhere in my 6300 sq foot house, so it seems the range is pretty solid.  I know range is affected by wall construction and other RF interference, though, so your milage may vary.

All in all, I'm definitely glad I purchased this unit."
3925463,1.0,"This tablet has become my lifeline.

I am ymbryne on ChickenSmoothie and use this tablet for all of my oekaki coloring. It's made sketching easier, goofing off, taking notes. I work using this to design flowcharts of story progression for my online story. It works amazingly well.

The number one issue involves a windows setting: you need to look up ""windows pen right click fix"" and follow those instructions in order to use it to draw. It takes under two minutes to fix and will stop you from beating your head against a wall.

Pros:
-Super long cord
-Tablet pen replacements run 15$ (not bad at all)
-Cord is common AND replaceable (my Wacom's power module died and that's why I bought this one in the first place) (It's a standard camera-type cable and I have like, 30 of them)
-Buttons look cool and probably do stuff but I don't remember what. Looks like Undo, Erase, Draw, Zoom in/out (funny shaped buttons), pressure+, pressure-, and touch? I use control z and a mouse in conjunction with this tablet personally, but that's my preference.
-Battery life is amazing on the pen. I think I've replaced it once... if ever... in two years now. I'm not a regular artist though.

Cons:
-Mine came with a pen rest that looks entirely too much like drug paraphernalia (but stores extra tips and the tip replacement tool)"

Additionally, this computer is running the Haiku operating system (a newer implementation of the old BeOS), so I was not certain that the operating system would get along with the card.
I need not have been concerned. I installed the card into an empty PCI slot, and booted Haiku. Haiku recognized the card and immediately connected. I was online in moments, with no drivers or configuration required.
The card also comes with a disc of drivers for Windows, and from the comments of other users, I'm confident that if it works so well for everyone else, it will work for me should I choose to run Windows on this machine."

I liked the Spec's they came with.

Everything went fine for about 3 months and then all 3 of the units stopped charging !!!!  :(

It has to do with the plug in port on the tablet itself.

You can research it on-line if you care to but it is a well know documented problem.

On 1 of the units the software or system is screwed up as well.  Every time you try to open an App it takes you back to the Play Store for some Reason. I have tried everything to fix it with no luck.

The reception is great, audio quality is great...otherwise a really nice unit.  However, there is a slight high frequency buzz in the unit.  My friend also has one...and has the same issue.  He never noticed it until I pointed it out...now it drives him crazy.(whoops).

The USB charger should be larger (2.1A min) for modern smart phones.

The wire that connects everything is thin...which is awesome for hiding, but the rubber/cover is low quality and is easily injured.

Review Update Jan 2015.

Unit finally quit working.  Replaced with another Bluetooth adapter...much better call quality and audio.  Never could figure out why people liked this unit so much...and now understand why people think bluetooth provides good audio.  Unit made noise whether car was on or off...and connected to my car or another audio device.  So a ground loop isolator would do nothing for a bad product/design."

It pushes (clicks) left for 'backspace' and right for 'forward.'  Put your cursor in the margin and press down on the scroll button and a 'scroll circle' appears to allow scrolling up and down by simply moving the mouse (and therefore the pointer)...the more movement = faster scrolling.  I have the MK320 wireless keyboard and mouse setup which shares a single dongle plugged in an available USB port.

If the Canon one wasn't so pricey I would stay with those but I really need to find a cheaper alternative and hoped this would fit the bill.

2749472,1.0,"I've previously owned a few different microphones, including a fancy karaoke microphone, a standard stage microphone, and even a shotgun microphone. No matter how I'd use the other ones, I'd always have to filter out extra noise in the background before I could use the audio for anything. This microphone makes crystal clear audio through my standard USB port, and it's really simple to get started using. I just plug it in and select it as my microphone in my audio editor, and it's good to go. I don't have to do any sort of post production to remove any noise, because there just isn't any significant amount of noise. All I have to do is decide where to start and end the clip in my editor. This saves me a ton of time with all of the editing I normally do.

I'd highly recommend though picking up a microphone stand to use this with. It's quite large to use with its included stand, and you don't want to pick up extra sound from your desk in case you hit it while recording. I'd also recommend getting a pop filter (just any cheap one, or make your own even with stockings if you don't want to spend $10), since you don't want to pick up pops from recording."

6148767,1.0,"Pros:
+ Awesome Sound Quality. Strong bass and good all around quality (feels like I am standing in the center of a 5.1 surround system with a woofer). Definitely the best I've heard in sub $70 earphones.

+ Very Nice case. Opens like a book with little mesh linings inside to hold the earphones and a tiny zipper pocket inside to hold the other size silicon inserts you're not using.

 + Excellent Finish. The earphones feel sturdy and have a nice glossy finish not found in this price range. The case is cute, classy, and quality fabric.

Cons:
- Slipping - Will easily stay in your ear while walking but once you start sweating (during a very hot day or while running) the earphones start to slip out.

Overall:
+ A steal! Even if I had paid 3 times as much I would have been very satisfied! Nothing in this price range can beat this quality."

4014353,0.0,"The cable seems alright and functions for the basic connection between two devices. However, the new devices place new demands on the cables - and a high-speed HDMI is what works in such cases. In my case, the Sony Bravia Sync was not working with this cable. Spent over an hour on the phone with the Sony rep. Finally, the Sony product specialist had me check the wire for its label, and specifically, if ""High speed"" or 1.4 was written anywhere. No, sir! Well, I had to go buy another one from a local shop and Bravia Sync worked flawlessly afterwards.

Bottom line - this is a cheap cable for basic needs. Do not expect high fidelity extras.

The astronomical $69+ advertised as the original price, which is now discounted to $2.25, must have been a dreamer's extra-special, XXXL dream! Even $2.25 seems high to pay for it, given its constraints."

He had bought a couple of used Direct TV TiVo's from a friend with plans on putting in a larger hard drive and getting a TiVo back up and running.  Now he'll be able to do this.

When you get a Direct TV DVR you don't own it, it is leased.  Even though I had to pay $100 to lease it and then another $5 a month.  Direct TV will only replace THEIR unit if you pay for a $70 service call and it is deemed a qualifying reason that the unit broke (whatever that might be).

The other good thing is HDMI version 1.3!! No more problems with people on TV or in movies having weird skin tones, when you up-convert to HDMI level.
The sound field programs are organized in a much better, usable fashion.
All together this is a great top of the line unit, I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good home theater receiver.
After I hooked it up and listened to the sound I was amazed, much better sound than the predecessors, and my living room is now like the movie theater down the street!
Changes I would like to see:
Larger speaker terminals so you can use spades in addition to the banana plugs, for those who bi-wire that way.
Zone 2 & 3 control should be visible automatically like it was on the RX V2600, but that is really no big deal.

2507434,0.0,"Thought I'd share this, because these problems are typically rampant throughout certain companies and their products.  My 50PK750 TV broke after 2.1 years. Called company, talked up the chain all the way to supervisor. They would not budge in any way to help except giving me part numbers should I plan to fix it. I guess their products are not expected to last beyond 1 year. Never again.

There are two types of electronics companies.  The one type like Sony, Pioneer and Intel test their products rigorously to ensure extreme reliability over an industry standard of 7 years.  And in the very unlikely case where items break through no fault of the owner, they respond in kind by fixing or replacing at any time beyond warranty under their discretion.  Then there are companies like LG and Onkyo, who treat customers like a bad disease after 1 year.  No thanks."

First of all, it looked like the radio had previously been returned by someone else.  The radio was not packaged well and the protective bumper around the radio was very dusty.  In addition, there were subtle but visible marks on the front face plate of the radio.  Also, there was a whitish stain on the right side of the radio. I was surprised at Amazon for charging me full price for a radio in this condition.  I was expecting a new product.

Finally, I own a couple of other Sangean radios and their performance is outstanding on all bands.  However, this PR-D18BK had voice distortion on the FM band.

All in all, this radio was not worth the $50 price tag."

Some Googling eventually led me to this unit, with no guarantees of success but some vague indication that if this wouldn't work, probably nothing would.

I'm happy to report that it worked with no frame skipping. Although this adapter is rated for 330MHz pixel clock, it's handling 443MHz pixel clock right now.  This could be luck of the draw, and this may impact the lifespan of the adapter. No idea. This is day 1. I'll update in a few months. Wish it were cheaper, but it does what I wanted it to do.

I get a brand new Lenovo ThinkPad laptop for work, and the HDMI port is hit or miss with the cables at my reach, and noticed that that it had a Thunderbolt port.  I said, lemme give this a try.  Boy, did this adapter put the actual HDMI port to shame.  This worked flawlessly.  I had to connect the HDMI-connected monitor through an adapter via Thunderbolt port vs. the HDMI port itself.  Had it not been for this, I would have had to resort to looking at a spreadsheet on a laptop screen vs. a larger monitor.  I was so impressed with this, that I had to buy a second one. One for my MS Surface Pro 3, and one to carry around with my work laptop for the ""just in case"". Ain't that something.  Anyhow, this product went above and beyond my expectations.  Tested with HDMI, DVI, not tested with the VGA connector yet, but 2 out of 3 confirmed tests successful.  This is a win in my book. Thank you KPTEC for making such a great product."
5274764,1.0,"These headphones have surprisingly good, clear, sound quality and a lot of bass. I am more impressed with them than I expected to be.

The earpieces are comfortable without being overly padded and bulky and the headband fits comfortably, as well.

It adjusts easily to fit your head and the band is actually pretty flexible.  There is a sort of silicone padding across the top center of the headband. This makes it comfortable and also helps keep the band in place on your head.

The ear padding does not totally surround/cup over your ear, but they do offer a good bit of noise cancelation.  They fit comfortably on the ear and do not cause aching feelings or discomfort even after having them on for a few hours.

They pair easily with my devices via bluetooth and I also used nfc with one of my laptops. The sound is really good coming for either type of source.

All controls are on the right side earpiece and are very easy to use and figure out. Answering calls is just a simple push of a button on the outside body of the earpiece.

Battery charge lasts plenty long and volume range is perfect.

All in all, these are a really nice choice in this pricerange, especially if you do not like the  larger size headphones. The folding function on these is nice as well."

I followed the directions and wired it into the Crux SOCGM-17 wiring harness with a Pioneer 380BT head unit. Plugged the harness in to the truck (2004 Silverado), turned the key and voila! it worked. My steering wheel has MUTE, PROG, VOL Up, VOL Dwn, Source, and Seek. All the buttons mapped to the correct function on the radio.

I saw this router that seemed to have a better range than my Dlink and the ability to use a USB hard drive as a network storage device (haven't tried that yet).  I will say that the range is significantly better than the Dlink (they're in the same place), but the setup was very complex and took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than any other router I've ever set up before.  The user interface in non-intuitive and caused me to initially set it up without any security (I've since changed it).  Overall I'd rate it a 3.5 due to the range and value equation - check prices at they change very often on this device.

UPDATE:  The unit failed after a few months.  Really would never buy it again as the set up was too complex and while it offered a very comprehensive advanced settings, the user interface, now coupled with the failure of the unit itself would cause me to recommend that you go elsewhere for a similar product (I've actually gone back to my dlink router that I discussed earlier until i do some additional research for a new one - again!!) ugh!!"

It also has issues with authentication, denying devices a connection at random times.  Those devices have to be rebooted to gain a connection.  I tried everything I could to get this router to work and never stopped getting complaints from people with Android phones, iPads, iPods, and even my PS3.  I got tired of all the ""what's wrong with your WiFi"" questioning so I traded this for a Netgear R7000 and it works perfectly under the exact same WiFi settings!  The latest firmware I tried is the one current as of this time of writing: the 291 firmware from late October 2013.  I hope that these issues will be resolved via firmware and hope they are not hardware problems for the sake of you who are sticking it out.  My recommendation, if you need a router that works now and you don't have a month or two to wait for firmware fixes, don't get this router.  This router certainly has potential as I believe it probably has the strongest signal of any router on the market: even stronger than the R7000.  The AC68's signal is about 5 dBM higher than the R7000 at far reaching locations but ultimately, a slightly better signal is no good if the WiFi isn't working right."

Let's start with the software not finding the NAS drives. Oh yes, either of them. Did I mention that I HAD 2 of them? Did I mention that both of them failed within a week of each other?  Did I mention that Seagate is warranting these drives and sending me back the same units;  I suppose with new drives? If I forgot to mention that, then I'm sure you will be pleased to know that as a professional video producer/designer/ videographer that I used these drives as back-up to a pair of Raid 5 tower NAS's. But I digress. If you are intent in having a total failure of drives, and a complete loss of ALL our data, then these are the drives for you! And if you  really want to have the same crap repaired and sent back to you so you can continue to hit your head with a hammer, than Seagate is your company. Save yourself and go elsewhere. If you really want to protect your data buy an Iomega Raid 5 2 TB or 4 TB NAS, be done with it and relax. Your data will be safe, yes at a price, but ask yourself, what's your years of data worth to you?"

The idea is you will ""sand off"" the damaged layer of the CD/DVD and then the laser will be able to view the content buried underneath.  Obviously, you can only pull that so many times before you eat through the plastic on the DVD and ruin it, but in principle it'll work at least once.  Even if you make some new minor ones which cosmetically look bad, they likely will not hinder the laser in the CD/DVD player enough to cause problems.

However, the included sheet is not abrasive enough to seem to do anything at all to any scratch.  In practice it did nothing.  Absolutely nothing for scratches.  Nadda.  Nothing.  It might have use for cleaning some surface gunk off the disc but that's hardly a ""repair"" as it claims to do.  It didn't manage to fix even a minor scratch for me.

845367,1.0,"I've been using printable disks for the past 3 years or so.  Whenever I buy I do a fair amount of research trying to find the best disk because I want them to look nice and I don't mind paying a few bucks extra.  I also hate throwing away disks halfway through the spindle because I find something else better.

Print at home disks have been a mixed bag for me.  Both the matte and glossy stick-on labels are of mediocre quality.  After that, I switched to the Taiyo Yuden printable disks (similar to these), but in matte finish.  This was an improvement in quality, but still not great.  The matte disks just turn out dull and not very crisp to me.  I figured that was just a result of printing at home and learned to live with it.

Now that the matte disks have run out I have bought these and am extremely impressed.  The color vibrance and image sharpness is exceptional.  It's easily on par with a glossy photo print you get from a quality print lab.  They are miles ahead of the matte disks in image quality.  I use an Epson Artisan 710 printer along with the Epson disk printing software and have no problems with these disks.  The ink dries quickly and doesn't smudge when I take it out of the disk tray.

Taiyo Yuden also has an established reputation as a top quality disk maker.  The last 100-count spindle of Taiyo Yuden disks I went through burned 100% perfectly.  I trust these will perform similarly.

For at home printing, these are THE disk to get."

The manufacturing process for this product must be totally devoid of any QA.

Your device says connection unsuccessful, make sure Jam Touch is turned on and in range.  But it doesnt matter if you're standing beside it or 2 feet away or across the room.  Weve tried all sorts of things.  Our devices pair quickly and easily with the other Jam and many other bluetooth devices that we have.

Yes, Yamaha has broken HDMI PassThrough since 2011. What the thread didn't discuss was how it not only gets the L/R audio, but how it also downsamples the audio to 48k.

I verified this with my own tests. No matter what I passed into the receiver, the HDMI PassThrough always outputted stereo 48k.

If you plan to use the HDMI PassThrough for anything other than a picture to a TV, do not buy a Yamaha Receiver unless it was made before 2011, because the HDMI PassThrough has been broken since then. Yamaha states that this is the intended behavior, yet they will not document this ""feature"" anywhere. If I had known about this ""feature,"" I would not have bought this receiver.

The install is a little difficult as each input wire and speaker wire is attached via a small screw on the back side.  I had to look to find my #0 phillips screwdriver.  The location is hard to get to, as you need to balance the box on the front knobs while inserting the wires and tightening the screws.

The good news you only need to do it once.

BTW, the directions are kind of limited, but the product is easy to figure out.  That said, please note that each screw is pre-tightened (to prevent loss), so you will need to start by loosening each one."

I know for more experienced people this may not be that great but for anyone new I think this is will help eliminate frustration. I was wasting connectors and time trying to learn how to do this the old way so if you are like me get these and move on with the project.. Things to remember is to get the right one for the right size since cat5 is smaller then cat6, even though you can make them work for each other I try to use the right one to avoid any issues, The most important thing to remember is after you strip the wire and separate the different colors, work on getting them together closer to where the cable comes out about 1/2 way, This seems to be easier for me and after that cut the ends since they are usually harder to keep straight and then you will have all the wires neat and straight and ready to push through, What I do then is push the wire through as far up as I can so that after I use scissors to cut the wire ends off I can pull the cable back out until the ends are flat with the connector and then I use standard cat crimpers to finish the job .... this has given me good clean connections , out of 13 crimps I only wasted one because I had put the wires in the wrong order and didn't realize it until after crimping it.."

Just one FYI tht has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself but rather the purpose: Keep in mind that this will not help you achieve a greater focal length with your telephoto lens; this is a macro extension set so it will only help you view objects larger that are reasonably close to you already. This set therefore has a very limited application as it is, but is made less useful with the poor build quality."

So far, the play, pause, fast forward and navigation functions work well enough for my needs. The mouse is usable but tedious, so you probably won't want to use it a lot. I use it to open Kodi from my start menu and then use the button functions from there to navigate Kodi menus. Not all keys or functions will work, but it's not hard to figure out which ones work and which ones don't. Very happy with this purchase."
216301,0.0,"Pros:

+ Feature rich

+ Decent sound quality for MP3 files

+ LCD on inline remote

Cons:

- Disappointing quality, flimsy buttons, feels like it's going to break anytime

- Crashes more often than other HD-based players

- Very ugly

- Heavy and bulky, esp. compared to iPod

- Very confusing user interface, too many menus

- Sometimes does not show up on Windows XP desktop

- Did I mention it's butt ugly?

For the first couple days you'd probably be thrilled with the many features the 140 includes.  But once the novelty factor wears off, and you start getting crashes, and people start asking why you are holding a black brick in your hands, you'll regret your purchase."

This is a fine unit. To really appreciate the speed of it, try reading to and writing from an SSD. I use this with Mac OS X 10.10.5 and 10.11.1 and it works very well, without disconnects others complain of. It is very easy to put the drive in, and has a solid feel. I very much like the three port hub and the on/off switch for the drive the enclosure contains. All appears to be quite solid and well made."

The device stops recording and makes several dozen 0 byte files you have to go thru to get the one file that's partially readable(this file will normally crash the PC). I have read there is a firmware upgrade but I don't know how to find it, or how to tell what version of firmware I already have. It's possible there is a simple fix, but I've yet to find it. So until you see the seller has posted firmware links you should not buy this product. 50% of the reviews say the same,"

109913,0.0,"maxell has been one of my trusted use for blank discs for longer than i can remember.

up until sometime in 2005...when maxell changed their discs.

heres the difference

the 2004 model has the maxell guy on rhe left, and the cdr/80/700 tihng on the right. on the top it says maxell in big letters. also if you feel the background, it is a whole lot more stable. it doesnt chip easily. also the plastic used was not scratched easily.

the 2005/2006 model is a whole lot worse. it says cd-r onl eft, highlighted. on top of that it has maxell in small letters. on the right it says 80/700 and the maxell guy is right below it. the top of the disc is obviously used with cheaper material, and it scratches easily.

another thing noticeable from the two is burn errors. ive had no burn errors at all with either of the 2004 models (regular or music). on the 2005 model at least 80% failed.

also when using nero express i tested imation and sony cd-rs just to make sure my recorder was ok. imation had a 10% fail rate and sony had a 0% fail rate...my recorder works fine.

also, i tried burning at slower speed with no better results.

why would imation and sony work on my computer and maxell wouldnt. because maxell cd-rs are garbage. avoid at all costs get imation sony or get maxell but only if the discs look like i explained on the 2004 modle becuase those were literally the best cdrs ive ever owned."

One obvious difference you might notice if you are moving from older TV sets is the 120Hz refresh ratio, which will make movies look like Live recordings. But that is the functionality of higher refresh ratios.

The one differentiating feature for me was the Network sharing feature through Wifi (No extra accessory required for TV, wifi card is atatched). Once you add the LG TV to your Computer Work Group, You can share Movies,Music and Pictures to TV from your laptop/Desktop and Hard drives wirelessly. And LG smart player supports many movie formats and clarity is impressive.

And if you want a single port adapter like this one, you can get one for about half the price.

Now, I could see how some people might think that only a branded ""Amazon"" power adapter can charge the Kindle. But this is simply not true. I have three Kindle devices, and constantly power them up using my multi-port USB chargers. You simply need to select a 5 W, 1 A port and you're all set.

I called tech support, and they said my warranty ran out-- which i told them was impossible since I had the receipt showing I bought it only 10 months ago and I was in fact out of the country when they said I bought it. I finally convinced them to help me and they got it going to 11 Mbps. The tech support guy then said 11 Mbps is a ""good enough speed."" I said that I didn't buy this overpriced product for a ""good enough speed."" He then proceeded to blame the diminished speed on the network, the router (which was a linksys router) etc. I told him that I had 4 other computers using other their own wireless receivers at 54 Mbps without a problem. I was convinced the thing was defective and demanded a replacement but they wouldnt give it to me since it still is technically working. I was very put off by these guys and their defective product.

I will strongly recommend not to by this piece of crap. The video quality is very bad compared to samsung WB750 that I bought earlier could record crystal clear voice and video.(However, I returned the samsung wb750 thinking better products are available, however now I regret, because they have increased the price of wb750 now)."

It's charged so that's that not the problem. Or course it can't  be returned or replaced.  3 months of wasted $40.00  for 3 months of use. So would recommend NO.

4524740,1.0,"Small platform and good performance.  Granted it does use Notebook internals, it does prove to perform well enough for most games.  This model could definitely be improved with a faster hard drive, but for a start, it isn't bad.

Noting Alienware/Dell has attempted to make their own game launcher for games that are from the Microsoft store and Steam, this gets a bit thick on implementation as multiple layers are running to support Steam full screen mode.  Alienware/Dell claims this device is ready for SteamOS, but I'm a bit concerned with the video card in it as I would need specifics on getting support for it."
1724471,1.0,"Perfect.  While I do consider myself to be a borderline audiophile, I was looking for a simple PCI-E sound card to take over the onboard sound chip and free up a little CPU bandwidth.  This card fits the bill perfectly.  I would place its performance somewhere between the typical Realtek onboard sound chip and a high end dedicated card - I notice an improvement through quality speakers / headsets, though I'm sure high end sound cards will sound better to the trained ear.

With that said - the audio is crisp, contains no white noise / static, and performs just as I needed it to."

I bought this disc in August 2016. I use it as a second disk, for data storage. At first everything worked well, however after two to three months the disc began to make sounds, like a ""click"" and a high pitched sound. Also the mouse on my computer was starting to fail. The screen froze.
When trying to access my files (photographs) is usually stuck. It does not work well. It was a waste of money. I have another seagate record that has been running well for years, but I regret buying this unit. It is simply a disk that fails at any time, does not read well and stops working at all times.

For some reason my wireless headset won't connect directly to the resident Bluetooth. I have to have a dongle, which my PC refers to as a Bluetooth radio device.

Very easy to install, easy to line up on device, easy to squeegee the bubbles out.  Just make sure to spray both sides of protector with the solution....allows squeegee to slide easily over it.  I just used a paper towel to blot up the fluid and let it dry overnight.  Took about 24 hours for all the cloudiness and bubbles to disappear.

I moved my SSD to this card and my read and write speed for the drive doubled. I expected to see a big change in Boot time but I didn't. The Accelsior S is actually about 5 seconds slower than native. But once the PC is booted and running, Disk I/O bound tasks run about twice as fast as the SSD in the IcyDock and about 4x compared to the 7200 RPM rotating media drive with which the MacPro shipped. For me this was a $57 purchase because I already added the SSD a while ago. Combine this with a good 500Gb 2.5"" SSD like the Samsung 850 EVO and the total spend is $225 or so. For me that's not a bad value. If you are upgrading your MacPro by replacing your main drive with a 2.5"" Form factor SSD then you will have to buy either something like an Icy Dock:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Icy-Dock-EZConvert-2-5-Inch-to-3-5-Inch-SATA-SSD-Hard-Drive-Converter/dp/B002Z2QDNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Icy Dock EZConvert 2.5-Inch to 3.5-Inch SATA SSD / Hard Drive Converter</a>&nbsp;or this card.

60Hz (now 120, or 240Hz is standard).  Its blacks were not great, but it was a decent set for $1500.

However, it just is not built to last, and this LG47LC7DF (and other LG 47 inch models) have been PLAGUED with reliability problems in the Digital Main Board, and in the power suppy boards.  Generally, the capacitors on the boards go, and they seem to do it around 2 years.  Some people get a little more (3-4 years), some people even less luck (1 year).

A digital set should last basically forever, no kidding.  This thing has cheap crappy failure prone capacitors, and the engineers and finance guys building and pricing it should be tied up and dragged down the street until the skin comes off.

The set in short is CRAP in quality.  Buy something else.  Based on LG's quality (no one really offers a warranty anymore, but some sets are actually designed to last), I would have to say that this is the last LG set I will ever buy.

Since nearly all of the SCREENS themselves are made by Samsung, the digital main board and the power supply from LG are the problems here (well documented).

So, expect to pay $150-$300 for a new main board in 2 years.  Or just buy a better set from someone else."

4061615,1.0,"I had mixed feelings when purchasing this TV. Although mostly positive, some of the negative reviews were concerning putting me on the fence whether to buy. Then I saw this model on T-Direct with rebate for 175 and could not resist.  Arrived yesterday. Connected to my satellite receiver and viola it came to life with clear and vibrant color.  I was a tv repairman in a former life so am critical of quality and performance. Firstly. No dead pixels. Good steady image with horizontal and vertical stable picture. Color too rich as it came without adjustment, image too much contrast (came set up for store display).  This is all adjustable. Has several picture modes to choose from or custom( which I preferred). Once accomplished, very acceptable.  Surprisingly the audio is pretty good. Bass leaves something to be desired but clear and decent sound. Three HDMI ports VGA, RCA, audio and even a USB port. actually very little this tv can't accommodate. I mounted on the wall.  Be careful to attach the mounting plate. The  built in receiver nuts are shallow so plan on using washers so you get a tight fit but don't over tighten as I am fearful of stripping out the nut. Btw it does not come with mounting screws ( odd). You will need to call their 800 number to get the remote code which is on their automated system. No problem here.  So far very good. I will update as time goes on."
384084,0.0,"I was unable to get a consistent, satisfactory signal with this unit because of the antenna; the rest of the unit worked fine.

I found that unless you had perfect exposure to the satellite that this antenna did not receive the signal very well. Also, the least movement of the connecting cord or if someone moved a blind/curtain, this would disturb the exact positioning required to make this antenna function properly.

In the end I returned this unit and got an extra car antenna (the one with the strong magnet); this allowed me to put an extension cord under the window sill to the outside. From here, I was able to easily find a site for the magnetic antenna that resulted in excellent satellite reception (exact positioning is not nearly as important for the magnet antenna). Since then my home unit has worked perfectly.

So...0 Stars for the headache in finding a secure, undisturbed spot for this unit. Makes you wonder if anyone at the company ever tried this unit before it went to market.

3089330,0.0,"UPDATE TO REVIEW:

I've been using a charger the two times I used it. I noticed that it didn't hold a charge at all.  Opened the back and noticed there is no battery!!! The description clearly says it comes with the Glo portable, battery, power cable.  Well no battery!!!!

--------------------------

Got it, tore the box open, plugged it in, paired it with my bluetooth iPad and took it on the road to see if it worked. It DOES!  PERFECTLY!!

I will be using this in conjunction with a boat charting app on my iPhone and iPad. I really got it for my iPad, but given that it will take the accuracy from 10m to 5m, I'll use it with my iPhone too. This now allows me to use my much larger iPad for navigation, which, given I only had the wifi version of the ipad I couldn't use. I have to preload maps on the iPad since I don't have internet connectivity, but with a preloaded map or chart it works perfectly.  Look at the dimensions of this as well...it is small and will fit in a shirt pocket if you wanted."

5530892,0.0,"I'm being generous by giving this product 1 star. Allow me to explain:

PROS:
1. Lightweight
2. Look amazing
3. Sound fantastic
4. Detachable cord
5. Good price and nice case

CONS:
1. Fingerprint prone (yeah I know its nit-picky, but it bothers me)
2. Detachable cord controls don't work with Android or even a PC (only with iOS devices; which is crap)
3. And higher volume levels, the sound begins to crackle (quite a bit at the highest level)
4. Return policy doesn't go past 30 days (my wife bought them 31 days before my birthday, so I cannot return them)
5. The worst part: SOUND BLEED!!!!

The sound bleed is easily the worst part of these headphones. I can't turn them up past 40% before EVERYONE in the room can hear what I'm listening to. This makes them almost completely useless to me as I was going to use them at work and around my kids but now I cannot do this. So much for that. Don't buy these if privacy is of any concern to you!"

When we had a 2-day power outage I tried it and even extensive cranking was useless for either the radio or flashlight.  I had purchased an Eveready crank rechargeable flashlight at the same time and it performed flawlessly, so it's easy to make a product with a reasonable battery and crank system.

Recommendation:  Get an emergency radio/light which also takes standard batteries.  Having been burned by this brand I won't buy another of their products, but I suppose the newer models may have improved."
1125130,0.0,"I need a Gigabit switch and optionally, a wi-fi access point and Wireless G/N for several security cams. The wireless ""G"" was ""comparable"" compared to my NetGear WPN824. The wireless ""N"" signal strength is a joke. Buy something/ANYthing else but!

But wait! That's only half the story. Cisco bundles their network ""defender"" software with the router. The displays are pretty, but that's where the usefullness ends and the trouble begins. I created an account and set a password. All which had to be done by logging into a CISCO Server. When my GF cleaned my office area, she ""disposed"" of the Post-It Note that had the pwd on it. So all weekend long, while attempting to add devices to the network using ANYTHING BUT 13-Year-Old-Security-Settings, no-go. I didn't have the password and CISCO's Server(s) used to perform these functions were 100% UNAVAILABLE! GOOD GOING CISCO. GREAT SERVICE! EVER HEAR OF HAVING A BACKUP SERVER FOR CRITICAL SERVICES!?!?! Apparently not.

Do yourself a BIG favor. Need a switch, get a Netgear. Need a Wireless N router, this is NOT what you want. AND EVEN WORSE, don't bother with their DEFENDER software.

AND you get a fast, fine blu ray player.

The Roku might have a slicker experience, but if you're familiar with the PS3, you'll be right at home with the ""cross media bar"" interface.

I plugged it in, connected to wifi, performed a system update, streamed both Amazon and Netflix to check it out and they worked great.  Blu Rays load as fast or faster than they do on the PS3.

At 99 dollars it's hard to justify a Roku over this.  There are other blu-ray players, even with apps, but considering Sony's involvement in the creation of Blu Ray I figured this would be the safest bet in terms of compatibility.  Historically some players have trouble playing certain blu rays, I figured Sony would probably be the most compatible."

Very nice unit. Bluetooth works great. sound is great. I do prefer the look of the original OEM radio over the glossy aftermarket look but that is just my opinion.

WHEN this one works, it's the best of the bunch.  Unfortunately, right now mine won't power up correctly.  For the past month it would intermittently power up, or not. (Yes, I tried a different power cord)  In addition, instead of automatically overwriting video files, occasionally this unit demands I remove and re-initialize the SDHC card.  I've learned to do it one handed while driving dropping the card into the dash only once.  So, again, for the first ten months I had this unit, it worked fairly well.  The tiny video screen CONFIRMS to you you are actually recording.  Playback to Mac works fine.  Video quality is good, not great (as with all these 1080P units, you CAN NOT read license plate #'s)  due to resolution and compression.  (A competing unit with a glass lens produces slightly better video quality)  This unit works well, the manual I found online (in english, unlike the one that came with it in Chenglish)...is ok.  I had to disable the G-sensor because the camera was stopping over rough roads.  That's ok.  The price is right, the size is right, and for the first 10 months I considered this the best unit currently available for under $100.  Purchased at Radio Shack, btw, and I'm right at the 12 month warranty, will report back on if they honor it."

452586,1.0,"Before this lens I used the canon 18-55 kit lens...I got tired of it because it never seemed very sharp and I would see quite a bit of CA in prominent compositions of a shot, even in the middle of the picture. I liked this lens as soon as I got it; it has a solid feel to it, without being too heavy. By f5.6 it is wonderfully sharp and still fast. The hood that came with it is also very nice; I just keep it on instead of a UV filter and it protects it fine. Never really liked those (filters) anyway, and the tulip keeps a great distance from the lens.

This is my walk-around lens, although for closeup work or small detail I will go to my 50 f/1.4 or 55-250 kit lens which has better color on macro work. If I had gotten a different lens for a mid-range walk-around, I probably would have just gone L, but I found this to be a great compromise; pictures are incredible. I gave this 5 stars because of performance/price, but performance by itself would probably be 4."

I installed the product and the software packaged with it.  I bought it to be able to receive faxes.  It installed with no errors and I was able to set it up and send faxes.  When i tried to receive faxes, it would answer the incoming call, it made the normal fax sounds and then would display the caller's phone number and caller ID.  20-30 seconds later, though, it made a sound like a cat being strangled and then hung up.  Checking the reception log, it says that it's empty.

I called TRENDNET support.  After taking contact details, the agent asked how they could help.  I explained the problem and they said that they can only help with installation problems and that i needed to call my ISP.  After some back and forth, i said fine, so I will need to return the product.  He asked if he could put me on hold and suggested that i call support for the bundled software, classic phone tools.  i called them and they said the same thing.  They only help with installation issues and they don't guarantee the software will work on Windows 7 and the i should have a nice life.

It comes with 4 strong bolts for the wall that expand when you tighten them. You can also hang this sideways from the wall instead of mounting it on the ceiling. The arm can extend to about 3 feet. The connection to the projector was easy, but you may have to put some spacers between the projector and the mount so the screws don't screw in too far and damage the projector. (Just screw the screw in with your hand without the mount to see how deep it goes and you can be the judge if you need shorter screws.

The sound is as good as digital gets, and I have had none of the drop-outs or other problems that other reviewers have written about. The solid snap that indicates a completed connection is always a welcome plus for any Toslink cable, and these are no exception. If you aren't familiar with this type cable, be advised that most of them come with some sort of protection for the signal leads at both ends, these having clear plastic tips affixed, which must be removed before attaching the cables. The covering is surprisingly supptle for an audio cable, and thicker, making them easy to route as necessary and offering superior protection for the optical leads inside.

I paired this cable with a Digital Fiber Optical (Toslink) to Digital (S/PDIF) Converter that I also bought from Amazon to connect my CD player to my AV receiver, which had only an assignable coaxial (S/PDIF) digital audio in connection left after all the other components were attached, and the pair have worked flawlessly together ever since.

It's form factor and presentation is stunning, the curve on it makes viewing amazing, however this TV's beauty is only skin deep the TV panel just doesn't deliver.

Compared to the HU9000 it's night and day, the performance between them is night and day.

Now that the 2015 JU7500 series is out I'd tell you if your interested in buying a TV I'd recommend the JU7500 or the HU9000 which are basically the same but the HU9000 has a camera and is slightly faster, but the JU7500 comes with Tizen and you'll need a Smart Evolution Kit to get that on the HU8700 or HU9000.

The only good thing about this TV is the Samsung 2014 Smart TV OS that it's smooth, feature rich and well crafted, not to mention my favorite feature is the Cable TV Guide integration made by Samsung.

However at the end of the day the biggest feature is going to be the quality of what you watching and this TV doesn't deliver compared to other similar priced Samsung tvs and competitors."

2484284,1.0,"This was the first time I have ever used banana plugs and they were incredibly easy to install.
I think the hardest part was determining how much insulation to strip back just so that you
have enough wire for the connector to grip but not so much as to show wire outside of the
connector.  Once tightened down the cable was locked in tight.  I gave ever single one a couple
of tugs and not one slipped out.

These worked great on my Klipsch KM series speakers and Onkyo receiver.  And they were
perfect for the super tight space between my receiver and wall. I use 14 gauge cable for
my fronts, center and subs and for the first time used ""SIIG 16-Gauge Flat Speaker Wire"" for
the rear surrounds and not one problem with either cable.

Now we only have settings for faster time, shorter route less fuel and off road. I have tried everything imaginable. I could get it to sometimes take highways when I would use the eco route settings and tell the unit I get 60MPG on the highway and 5mpg in the city. Set it for less fuel and it would sometimes work. Even with this it would then take me 30 miles out of my way to get where I'm going. There is no happy medium. I've used Google maps to map routes I know and it comes up with a common route. My Magellan does the same. This unit has its own mind that is different. I have done side by side comparisons with my five year old Magellan road mate. It wins hands down in routing. I talked to tech support and they give me basic tips which I know I've done Faster route ect. I've updated the software and the maps to no avail.

I never experienced the following issues with my previous router:
1) It didn't connect smoothly to my modem, but after I restarted both a couple of times it connected.
2) The router hanged in the first hour around 4 times, I had no clue whether it's the network, the laptop, my wired PC or the Modem and troubleshooting concluded it's the router.
3) I upgraded to the latest firmware as of Nov 2008, still tons of issues, it works after I reboot cleanly for 5 mins or so, then wireless connections keep falling very frequently especially if I'm using more than 1 wireless or wired connection, also my PS3 and Vonage were not performing as well as before.
4) At best my Asus Wireless n got me a 65MB compared to 54MB for my old g card, but the signal faded very quickly to 34MB.  But as it crashes like 10 times within 2 hours it's not worth it.  Switched everything to G and still it drops the connection with any mid / heavy wireless usage pattern.
5) Used back my old router and everything working like a charm, I'm returning this now....  likely those who like it have a single connection or not using /n  in this case I advice them to save the money and go for a different router."

MoCA device placed in master bedroom, ethernet output feeds a pfSense network box on its WAN interface.  The pfSense LAN interface connects to an 8-port gigabit ethernet switch which is then cabled to my various devices that had been connecting over WiFi (TV, Roku, BluRay player, ...).  I also connected a 2nd WiFi router to the switch so I could have a second WiFi network on this end of the house.

The Actiontec MoCA device connected as soon as it was powered up and gave me the equivalent of an ethernet connection between my Verizon box and my pfSense security router.  Everything worked perfectly and has been running for weeks at a time without any need to reboot anything.

I have not checked to see if the latest firmware is installed, it likely is as I have had none of the speed slowdowns others have mentioned.

It is sharp, the bokeh (out of focus area) is delicious and I'm so glad I bought it together with the X-E1 and the 18-55 zoom lens.  I love the system! I don't carry my D700 or D800 around anymore."
6018923,1.0,"This charger looks like it was designed at Apple and works like it does as well.  All the features are well thought it.  Without a 3rd party charger, Apple wants you to charge the Apple Pencil by inserting it into the lightning port of the iPad.  While this works, it just feel wrong.  It also feel like the pencil could easily break off, if you are not careful.  With this charger, you just put the pencil into the female part of lighting connector on the charger and plug in the charger.  That's it.  The TechMatte is small, but it's hefty.  It's not going to slide off your desk easily at all. TechMatte also has a place for store the cap of the pencil so that you don't forget where you placed it while the pencil is charging.  If you need to take the charger with you, it's small enough that you can carry it without difficulty.

if you know of someone with an Apple Pencil, I think this is a great gift to give to them."

4147074,1.0,I bought one of these on a military base in Eastern Europe three months ago and I LOVE IT! The wireless feature and optical cable are perfect for my setup in my room. If I had known I could get it for $199.99 instead of the $239.99 on base I would have ordered it here. The sound is good and the separate volume for the subwoofer is a good idea. I have a 48 inch Sony TV and I am very happy with this purchase
1737683,0.0,"** Update**

Things have gone downhill.  They worked OK for a couple months.  Now, not a single one of my phones will work for more than about 15-20 minutes.  I have to run around the house switching phones when the battery low indicator comes on.  At least I'm getting some exercise.  Genuine Panasonic batteries on order.

** Original review **

I have a Panasonic KX-TG5634 which is a cordless phone base with 4 handsets.  It's served me well over the last 5 years or so, but I began to have problems reported by others in these reviews.  Sometmes my handsets would ""reboot"" when switching to speakerphone, or randomly lose contact with the base.

Reviews here were more positive than negative for these knock-off brand batteries, I figured I'd give them a shot.  Installation in my four handsets was pretty painless.

I initially saw the problem that many of the negative reviews posted:  Even though the phone showed full battery power, the phone gave up a ""low battery"" warning after just a couple minutes of use.  However, by removing and re-installing the batteries at this point, the phone correctly showed a low battery indicator and then allowed me to charge it for several hours.  I can now talk for several hours and only see one bar lost on the phone.

I think what's happening is that the batteries don't really come fully charged, but the phone thinks it's a full, so it prematurely stops charging.  After exercising them all a bit, they all work great now."

Let's begin. First off all, this is not made by Belkin. It's an off-label brand that they have rebranded as their own. Yet it actually has less functionality than the off-label product.

Pros:
The video preview quality is decent. That's it.

Cons:
The software crashes all the time.
A 3-second animation plays every time you open the app, even if the app was just idle!
The camera keeps losing the connection to the iPhone app, so you need to quit the app and relaunch it constantly.
The video recording on the software is limited to about 2 frames per second.
The buttons for recording or taking a photo have childish sounds attached to them and they can NOT be turned off. Even if you put your phone on silent.
The recording of video stops at random places, probably caused by notifications on your phone.
You have to sign up for their service, giving them a username, email and password in order to use the camera. There is NO way around this. This means at any time Belkin can watch your camera!! Now wait a minute, you think this won't ever happen? After I sent 3 emails through the app to Belkin, a notice popped up on the screen of my iPhone stating:

Logged out!
There has been a log-in of the same
username and password from
another computer device.

5960747,0.0,"I've owned this tablet for over a year now, and I would not buy another Samsung Tablet. For whatever reason, Samsung has blocked US models (via firmware I assume) from accessing WIFI channels 12 & 13 (EU) and 14 (Japan & other countries). This means that if you travel anywhere in the EU where channel 13 is used, business, home, caf, or otherwise, you won't be able to connect and that's just too bad for you.

I've called up Samsung tech support and tried to sort this out, but the techs got confused between TV Channels and WIFI channels. Once I was able to educate them, they forwarded me to a ""supervisor"" who informed me there's nothing to be done about the Samsung-created limitation. Yes, the US doesn't allow Channels 13 or 14, but that pertains to broadcasting. There's no reason why a client shouldn't be able to access 13. There's no law against that. By way of comparison, my acquaintance's iphone and ipad, sold in the US, can access Channel 12 or 13 in the EU.

The new battery 2600mAh lasted all day with %90 remaining with nearly %25 transmit time.

I have only 1 complaint. Lack of memory banks. It has 999 programmable frequencies. But, it doesn't have banks to save them in. On a scanner, you can save your police channels in 1 bank, your frs in another, etc etc,  then scan only 1 bank to make sure you are not scanning and listening to unwanted channels.

Definitely not a deal breaker since I have a scanner to use anyway. I don't think I could be any happier than I am with this, my first radio.
DON'T BOTHER WITH THE SOFTWARE!!!
The radio is very easy to program manually, especially if you are used to using a scanner. The version that was sent for this, was incomplete and unusable anyways."

Within the first week, the tip for the right ear broke.  No wires got disconnected but it looked like it unglued or something.

The other issue was that if I was listening to a song, it would just cut it in the middle and jump to another.  This is without me touching it.  Crazy!!  It's like the phone would malfunction.  Just do it's own thing.

I would not recommend these to anyone."

Since the TV is in a bedroom on the far end of my house; I decided to avoid the wireless adapter and try the Linksys PLK300 Powerline Adapters.  I haven't tried video streaming; but everything else has worked well.  There are other vendors of these types of adapters which may work for you; but these worked the first time.  I did not use the encryption feature, which I see as most beneficial to apartment or condo residents who may share wiring.  I have connected my Tivo to the adapter and it has also worked fine. My home is less than 10 years old; so I did not have the complicated wiring or rewiring that people with older homes might deal with."

4006773,0.0,"since i have Blackvue DR500 WIFI, i needed another one for my wfie's.
I choosed this LK-7700 since price is very competitive and quality is very good.

Goods:
- Price is cheap comparing to other brands.
- Full HD
- Very easy to set up
- Other accessory comes with it
- GPS builted in
- Speed indicator is nice
- Since it's offically sold by Lukas, Warranty should be covered if unit has problem.
Bads:
- Adjustment is little poor and i need to use Hex driver it comes with.
- Plastic Bracket looks very weak and might break as instruction indicates
- It's difficult to set up correct time and it gets way off when car turned off and come back. (I turned Time off from configuration)

Overall, I am very satisfied with this unit.
I will update again if something happens.

UPDATE 2: Today is 12/2/14 and works as new!
Update 3: Today is 5/2/16 i have 2 of this and one is having Error1 sometimes which it indicates ""repair it"" i will try to update firmware and see if it resolve this issue
Update4: 5/29/16, other unit had same issue now which is Error1. exactly about 2 years period having that error as first one i had.
possibly making unit to have serviced after 2 years or make customers to buy new one! of course 1 year warranty is useless

5618559,0.0,"TP Link has failed me again. Last time it was a wifi repeater that repeated the signal but dropped off every 1-2 minutes. This time it was a router with a simple setup that would not detect any of the IP settings and required me to look them all up. Then it refused to access WAN and kept suggesting I contact my ISP.

I do not have time for this type of crap and resetting the router and inputting in the IP and DNS information by hand repeatedly to try and make it work is not worth a small discount over something reputable. Especially when I kept thinking of how their damned repeater worked for about 1-2 days then started going haywire. I threw everything back in the box after 1+ hours of troubleshooting and I'm going to buy a Cisco or something. Good riddance.

I thought about buying another speaker, and then I figured something out. Unlike many people, what I needed was not a speaker to share the sound with other people. What I needed was a speaker that would let me hear the telephone ring and other surrounding sounds, while listening to the sound device. This includes when I'm walking around the house and when I'm walking outdoors

I made a discovery that works great for me--and avoids me having to wire up, battery-power, and carry a speaker around. If the sound device has a mono switch, I set it on mono, and insert only one earpiece into one of my ears. That way I can hear surrounding sounds with the other.

There are some devices that do not have a mono setting, and then you might wind up missing part of the sound if you only used one earpiece. But a whole lot of devices do have this. It works GREAT for me."

It installs easily, though the temporary install wouldn't work with my computer. Unless the bottom is super smooth the temp install won't stick as it uses tiny suction cups.

3612712,0.0,"I've owned over 30 pairs of IEM's and earphones (up to the $1500 AKG K3003I), and I can honestly say that the previous generation shures (i.e. the SE530) are better than the current generation shures (i.e. the SE535).

In my opinion, Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE535 (replacement of the SE530) to save money. Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE530 (and the previous generation of shures, e.g. SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality. The new version (SE535) doesn't go as much into your ear, and it doesn't fit at all with a lot of people...

Honestly, just because of the fit issues, the SE530 sounds much better than the SE535. It's kinda like windows vista when it first launched. The previous generation is better. Period.

Also the SE535 loses the PTH function, which was cool because it allowed you to hear your surroundings by pushing a button. Bummer."

The first box always had an error light and after performing a bunch of tests for them, it was determined to be defective so they replaced it with another set.  The next box did not have an error but would not pass a signal.  I tried 3 Sources (Directv HD DVR, Sony 1080P unconverting DVD, Toshiba 1080P upconverting DVD) and 3 different destinations.  Nothing worked.  Support was really nice, but they kept harping on refresh rates (MHZ) and suggested trying a computer where refresh could be selected.  This makes me believe the product is designed for computers and not consumer electronics equipment.  In consumer electronics the HDMI refresh is dictated by the resolution.

When it comes to the best product for the money you just can't beat TOSHIBA.  The Specs speak for themselves.  [..] was the best buy.  I ordered the TV Nov 28th and it was delivered on Nov 30th with free shipping.  The best part was 15 days later I went back into Amazon.com and the TV had been reduced by $[...].  I sent Amazon an E-Mail and within 2 days they had credited my account for the difference.  I will always shop with Amazon.com and I highly recommend them to everyone."

My only complaint is a very poor quality TN LCD, which makes image very blurry.  Also, unlike IPS LCDs (or better quality TNs) it has a very narrow vertical viewing angle, so that colors change a lot when tilting the screen even a little.  For me, this makes it very hard to use in portrait orientation, because my left and right eye see any part of the screen from a different angle, so the colors appear differently for each eye.  This doesn't make me sick or give a headache, but it's very unpleasant.  So I use this tablet only in landscape mode.  But again, for such a low price - it's not a big deal."

That is extremely helpful when sitting outside on a picnic table enjoying the warm weather with my laptop and wanting to cool down a bit.

1411075,0.0,"I really did not expect a lot from this hard drive.  It should have been a straightforward device but unfortunately it never worked.  I have tried everything from formating, error checking, you name it.  The problem appears to be too many bad sectors which are making this drive unusable.  If you read the numerous reviews online you will find that even if you get one that works it will likely fail in due time. Not worth the price (even a low price).  Seagate should recall this product.

*** Positive Points: ***
- low price
- high capacity

*** Negative Points: ***
- Did not work
- lots of reports about drive failure even if it did work
- The fuss free packaging is not a good idea because on a sensitive device such as a hard drive, you want as much packaging as possible to buffer and protect the hard drive from bumps during transportation.

Conclusion: I would have liked for this product to work but a DOA product is unnaceptable in this day and age.  What ever happened to R&D and quality control?"

4438899,0.0,"Oh I really wish I would've read the reviews before I purchased this drive. I bought it specifically to house my many audiobooks in my car to avoid having to stream them from Google Play on my phone.

I received it in the mail and put in in my computer to start the upload... Nothing. It immediately went into "":breathe"" mode. There are three USB ports on my computer, two of them are SS, the third is normal. It only worked in the normal drive, which coincidentally is the one that is always occupied by my keyboard/mouse dongle. I remedied that problem by disabling the ports, then it worked.

The drive runs extremely hot. My fingers are callused because I do a lot of work with my hands, so I generally don't have a lot of sensitivity to moderate temperature changes. This drive got so hot that I was able to feel the heat, but not being sure how hot it was I handed it to my wife and it was uncomfortable for her to hold. It cooled quickly, but it concerns me that it may cause damage to whatever it is plugged into if left in long enough.

I load all of my books on it the night I got it. In the morning I was excited that I will be set for my commutes. I get in the car, plug in the drive. Nothing. The car doesn't even recognize that I've plugged anything in. I honestly didn't need another thumb drive - I have plenty. I bought this for one sole purpose and it does not perform in that capacity.

2689297,0.0,"Bought 32 and 64gb based (from two different resellers here) on the few reviews that are out there but didn't read online comments of other people having problems as unfortunately as these drives are not useable. All issues noted below are being noted in discussion forums on Windows and Mac systems.

1: On two different Windows 7 and one Windows 8 64 bit system they would generally work on USB 2.0 but often caused the desktop to freeze for a bit and would disconnect and reconnect occasionally.
2: On the USB 3.0 ports (where I have USB 3.0 drives working great), they won't stay connected for more than a few seconds and nothing can be copied to or from these.
3: If you try to do a format on the drive like you might do to quickly clear any hdd or flash drive, it will become useless as it will not format (used multiple systems, methods, and apps to try after initial failure).  Discussion on the Sandisk forum about others experience this as well and no one (as of this post) saying it has worked for them.

Net: do not gamble on these Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 flash drives at this time.  There is no flashing of bios for Sandisk flash drives so you can't expect it to be fixed in the future.  If they announce a recall or a new batch that are fixed (that you can be sure you have the new batch), then reevaluate."

I don't use the belt loop on the back as a belt loop. Instead, I keep an empty 2GB SD card (in the little plastic snap case) in that belt loop. It fits perfectly! It expands my video capacity from 17 minutes to 34 minutes, which is very cool.

I was willing to believe some kind of charging failure, but I probably should have contacted the battery vendor as they would have been in warranty.

Today, 10/14/16, the other UPS failed in exactly the same manner. Call from neighbors about electrical smell, ups hot an running even though there was no power outage. I'm currently 600 miles away, so can't verify of the batteries have expanded.

At this point we're a bit beyond coincidence -- both units have been recalibrate within 5 years, but since these aren't factory batteries, I can't push back there. The first pair failed in 10 months, the 2nd in 18 months in the same manner, which leads me to think I may have gotten a bad batch.

Not sure what else to do here... it would be helpful if Amazon had a ""contact manufacturer"" link instead of posting a review."

I put ""4K Computer Monitor"" under 'Computers' in the search box, and this is the 1st one listed.  WOW!  A Samsung (love the brand), and for such a comparatively low price!  After talking to a friend, telling him I might buy this.... he said he'd never heard of one this cheap, especially a Samsung.  Upon going back and reviewing carefully, there is NO mention that it TRULY IS a 4K, and in fact, the resolution listed says it is NOT a 4K UHD monitor.  What a disappointment that would have been!

113337,0.0,"I must have gotten a bad lens based on these reviews but then again maybe they don't have to look at thousands of images at 100% in a photo editor. This is the worst lens I've ever owned. It is soft, soft, soft. Even my cheap 50mm 1.8 is significantly sharper.

One reviewer said it's sharp on all four corners; not mine. It is embarrassingly fuzzy on the corners at any aperture and the edges as well as the middle too and forget about zone focusing. One of the great things about a lens like this is you can supposedly zone focus so that at .f. 8 everything from 5 ft. to infinity is in focus - wrong.

For the price this lens is a rip-off. This lens does have a sweet spot but you'll wait a long time finding it and it'll happen once in a blue moon. How can an image from a lens shot with a Canon 5D at 1/500 and .f. 8 on a sunny day be soft? Unbelievable. Another reviewer wrote it can be had used for 30 Euros - I don't doubt it.

The computer booted fine, but as soon as it was under load (gaming, benchmarks) the video output would crash and then moments later the whole computer would hard reset.

We checked out the new WiFi models with this camera's features, but found they were not reliable, basically all brands (don't need that anyhow).

3465111,0.0,This product is terrible and in no way is a reflection on the seller.  The volume for this headset is way too low.  I'm in an office environment and with it at full volume I can still hear people talking around me with ease.  It does not get loud enough.  The batteries for the earphones are inside each earpiece so you have to unscrew the speaker covers to replace them.  The problem with this design is that these keep coming loose and fall off when I am handling these headphones. Even when I am not twisting them.  It's hard to tighten them down because the covering that goes over this cheap piece of plastic slips and is cheap too. I have to jiggle it in the base station every time in order to get it to make contact with the charging connectors and sometimes I have to push it to lean backwards to make it charge.  This thing is a giant piece of junk and you should look elsewhere for a better product.

I thought this will help, but it was just a waste of time. No power comes up to either one.

Turns out my problem was the wireless transmitter at the back. It was defective. I was too tired to fish the old transmitter (not really old but I meant the original one I initially used) under trunk covers so I just hooked up an extra transmitter as a kind of a last solution to the reverse light wires before I scrap the project and have a ""pro"" do it. And it worked! Clear with the engine running or not.

1127116,1.0,"This Laptop Notebook Cool Pad w/3 Fans is the BEST one. I have bought a couple of Laptop Notebook fans (not this brand) from other places, and they would break down or give up in a very short period of time, maybe a month if I was lucky.

My laptop fans get long daily use because I am disabled, and my laptop is my link to the library, my music, my family and friends.  On bad days, when I am too sick to do much, I listen to books and music on my laptop for hours, so keeping my laptop cool is important.

I really like this model:

1.) The lights still work after several months of use.
2.) The fans are still going strong, and they actually do cool the laptop.
3.) Most fans just use the USB port, and that's all you get.  This one has a USB connection that allows you to plug something else into its connection so you can still use the USB port for a light, printer, iPod, etc.
4.) The wire for the USB port actually stays connected.  (Other fans - one tug and that's it, the fan is broken.)

If it ever wears out, I am going back to this seller for another one."

In fact, it's almost too powerful for a small room. The sound is fantastic, clear with plenty of bass if you like rock. The system comes with both preset and manual equalizers. There is a USB input and a jack for a mic. It also has a music port for MP3 other players. I haven't tried it since I don't have an auxiliary player. The AM and FM work reasonably well on the antennas provided. I can't say it's wonderful, but since I live in an area where reception is poor, I can't criticize it either. If you like pounding bass you can make this system rock. When the bass is strong, the super woofer and the lights on the control box pulse to the rhythm of the bass. It looks cool. I think this system would be excellent in a recreation room, particularly where young people party.

One caution: the system is rather large. It's over three feet long and the tall components are more that fifteen inches high. The super woofer itself is more than twelve inches. You need a substantial shelf or a table to support the system.

I use the system mostly for CDs and I love it. One drawback is that you can insert only one CD at a time, but for me that's not a major problem. I think this system is an excellent choice if you have room for it and would be wonderful for parties."

I use studio headphones and have in my home studio arsenal cans by Shure, Sony, and Beyerdynamic. These Sennheiser HD202's are simply amazing not just for the price point but for the comfort and function. The sound quality is absolutely stellar, even when listening to a 48khz AAC+ web radio stream. And now that I have these, I've noticed them being used in radio studios and being included in condenser microphone package deals. I also like the belt-clipping cable spool that comes with it so you can wind up the non-coiled cord neatly.

Haven't used these for studio work as of yet but they do sound comparable to my $200 Beyerdynamic 770's and sound much better than my Sony MD7506 cans."

The extended capacity battery is bulky and heavy but since I'm already using a 17"" laptop that's not really that portable to begin with there's really no loss. It does lift up the back of the computer, which is fine with me, its actually a more comfortable position to type in and probably helps with cooling.

We had concerns about the picture quality given their older computer (probably 5 years old) computer and relatively slow internet connection (Qwest/Century Link) with max download/upload of approximately 4000kbps/700kbps.  The upload was our real concern.

We decided on this camera because it would not require major computer CPU power to encode the video and would provide a smaller, more optimized video stream (in theory).

This time, the theory appeared to work!  I was very surprised at the quality of the video in both directions.  Since I was on a very fast 4G connection on my cell phone (for the other side of the video call), we were able to test everything from the grandparents' computer...with the cell phone in the next room to avoid audio feedback.

Very pleased with the installation, too.  Simply plugged in the camera, installed Skype, started video calling.  Really couldn't have been much easier at all.  I had never used Skype before, either.  Very happy with this purchase!"

2-The amazon app itself can't stream 4K content (yes, my internet is fast enough, yes, I have Amazon prime, yes I'm picking the right content). After spending 1hr with Amazon support, they don't know what is going on

So basically the 2 key qualities of this TV which is 4K and 3D are questionable at this point. Amazon is investigating but if what Netflix support said is accurate, buying a 3D Tv this days is... well... plain stupid."

I'm not pleased with this cover's performance, although we loved it initially.  If it broke that soon, with his ginger handling of his tablet, I'd be afraid to buy this brand for one of my tablets, as they are shoved into my purse, computer bag, etc. or even slid under the car seat or handed to my 4 year old granddaughter to entertain her on a road trip.  I have NEVER had a case break like this before, even with my comparatively rough use.  To have one fail with careful use only by a middle aged man is extremely disappointing.

We probably buy a dozen cases a year, between our tablets and those we give as gifts (Kindle-the gift that encourages reading!)

As far as I could tell this is a hardware problem since it does the same in microsoft as well as different flavors of gnulinux. this review is also taking me a long time to write as the keyboard just stopped working a few times to giving me random presses. if you must buy this, you will need to buy a separate keyboard. the keyboard is just horrible, the tab that holds the stylus also broke within the first few weeks."

Pros:
-very fast ssd
-good specs

cons:

-only 128gb is unacceptable for a 1300 laptop

-a bit pricy

6734353,0.0,"Look at Toshiba's history before buying.

I have a 2015 core i7 $800 laptop and it lasted 7 months before becoming an $800 piece of garbage.  I sent it in for repairs, Toshiba FAILED to fix it, they sent it back to me still broken.  I called them within two weeks and told them it was still broken, and guess what -- they would not repair it because the warranty was expired.  Even though they acknowledged that the problem causing the laptop to be completely unusable occurred while the unit was covered by warranty, acknowledged that the problem was exactly the same before and after I sent it in for repairs, and they acknowledged that I called them and informed them that the problem had NOT been fixed.

Toshiba gives you a ONE-YEAR warranty.  That is EXTREMELY short.  Most hard drives give you a 3+ year warranty.  Intel provides a 3 year warranty on their CPUs, which Toshiba puts into their computers.  Gigabyte motherboards give you a THREE YEAR warranty.

Why would a company give you nothing more than a ONE YEAR warranty on an $800-900 piece of hardware?"

If you're on carpet, it's especially important to elevate your machine off the floor if you have a good computer with the power supply unit properly on the bottom. If you have a retail machine, they probably put it at the top of the machine, which sucks, but it's still nice to have the bottom not smothered for better air flow. If you have carpet and don't lift the machine off of it, you might as well duct tape up the bottom of your desktop.

So I called them. They told me 3 times they could not get a charge to go through on my credit card. Frankly I don't think the woman on the other end of the phone was smart enough to get my address right, and that may be the problem.

I'm glad they are so awful as far as service and their website, because I got out of paying the unfairly high and usurious subscription fee, for which I am thankful."
879525,1.0,"I bought this along with a sandisk 16 gig SD to quadruple the memory in my PSP 3000. The adapter works perfect, not only as an adapter within a card reader on the PC but inside the PSP.

This was a much more inexpensive way for me to upgrade my memory on my PSP. I paid an incredible less than ten dollars for the sandisk 16 gig bulk packaging (it was advertised as retail packaging, but I don't care, as long as its a genuine sandisk and new, which it was) with no shipping charges (look around and you can find sandisks sold on amazon very cheap!), and then paid a couple of bucks for this reader/adapter, also with no shipping costs, and it works marvelous.

Its main limitation is that you cannot hot swap it... once you format the SD inside the reader inside the PSP you cannot take it out and use it without reformatting. The workaround is to use the USB cable for your PSP and you can swap data that way - such as add pictures, music, even videos if you've figured out how to format videos that don't come from PSP network for the PSP (there's a way Fyi, use format factory and tutorials on the web), and you can also take data out this way."

I was informed though by asus that I should still send it in due to the exterior damage caused by their facility... so... 6 months of owning this computer not being able to go past two weeks of usage and I get the same error every time... the only reason its taken me six months is because I HAVE TO KEEP BORROWING OTHER PEOPLES COMPUTERS AFTER SPENDING 900$ ON MINE AND IT  DOESNT WORK!.

Old review:
Look like these days it is hard to find a hard drive which does not have problems. I have two backup of my drive just to be safe. This drive does not have any software pre-installed. I use Norton Ghost to back up my C: drive and use it as a output drive for Adobe Production Suite. So far it is working really well. It has a shake detection sensor which parks the drive head when any minor shake is detected. With the drive price dropped so low, I would certainly recommend anyone who plans to buy a drive considering one which has this feature. I have a two-year-old Toshiba notebook with a internal drive which has this feature.  My only experience with Toshiba service is actually very good. My 2 and a half years old drive (3 years warranty) starting to automatically disconnect and reconnect to my notebook in January. I contact Toshiba and they replaced my old 250G one with a Cavio 320G one. The whole process is very smooth. Strongly recommend it!"

How they made a tablet without screen mirroring or the ability to use other USB drives by OTG seems to be intentional.  I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get my kids tablet to mirror the tv.  I thought it was me being stupid.  So I let them borrow my Note 8 in a silicone case, vs. the wonderful foam monstrosity this is in, so that they could mirror Cartoon Network.  They dropped it and shattered it to shards.  LOL.  So now, with this as the only working tablet in the house, I buckled down to figure out screen mirroring.  Guess what?  There is none. Samsung decided to intentionally handicap this tablet. You may be able to root it to bring back the functionality, but that's too much work for me.  I was giving it 3 stars.  Were it not handicapped, it'd be at least 4 stars. 7"" is a little small.

593196,1.0,"The 4061F works perfectly in our house and the picture is stunning.  I would have preferred the 4065's higher contrast ratio and 10bit video processor but couldn't live with the shiny screen.  To my eye any gains from a higher contrast ratio and more powerful video processor were wiped out by the annoying reflections in the shiny screen.  I couldn't be happier with the TV.

Now for the negatives.  The free ""white gloves delivery service"" was a cruel joke.  The TV finally arrived after a 3 week litany of bungled orders, lost shipments, 2 wasted days waiting for deliveries that didn't come, hours on the phone attempting to contact customer service and culminated with two clowns tracking heavy grease from one end of my house to the other.  Essentially Amazon didn't know what they had shipped and the carrier certainly didn't know where it was.  The experience was so bad I will never order from Amazon again unless the item is shipped by UPS.  Lost work days, aggravation and carpet cleaning make the ""free"" delivery very expensive."

1928951,0.0,"My little sister has a pair of these on her desk, so I thought I'd giver them a try. They're passable with a lot of modern music (electric guitar, electronically generated music, studio vocals, etc) but are stupidly deficient at anything with a significant high-end component. Which basically means anything recorded with a microphone more than a few feet away from the source.

Anything symphonic sounds like it's being played while someone strangles me with a pillow--it actually sounds better on the $2 earbuds I got from Walmart to keep around as emergency monitors.

Build quality of the headphones themselves seems pretty good, which initially gave me high hopes for the sound quality when I first picked them up. But the flat cord seems very fragile as a result of its thinness. And the flat makes any knots or coils more tightly packed, which means they're actually much worse. A nice thick, round cable (different from a ""cord"") is always better for anything but earbuds.

Bottom line; don't buy if you're planning on listening to something other than electronics, three-piece-band or, say, solo bass guitar. But, if you're a viola player who has always wanted a pair of magic headphones that made those arrogant violinists just disappear, these are clearly for you.

I'm giving two stars because there are probably some genres for which these are just fine, and they look cool.

Know what? I take that back. They sound awful with techno and rap too. One star."

5102818,0.0,"I purchased this TV at Costco to replace a Vizio M55-C2 because of picture problems.  The Sharp has a great picture but the following problems are too great to overcome the good picture.
1. The remote is garbage.  The buttons are cheap plastic and the TV, no more than 10' away from the couch doesn't respond to every button press.  The remote buttons are small and the Netflix button is huge so I ended up clicking it by accident frequently.
2. The remote control App for my smartphone (droid) doesn't work, it never finds the TV on the same WI-FI network.
3. The audio has a major bug.  After the TV has been off for a while the audio (connected with an optical cable to a Vizio sound bar) doesn't work unless you unplug the TV and plug it back in.  This is a major hassle because the TV is hanging on the wall.

It's truly a shame this 4K TV has a good picture, but the rest of these problems cause me daily grief.  This TV is headed back to the store..."

I don't know why I thought that would be enough when I purchased it but with picture sizes being what they are I quickly ran out of room.  It got to the point that I was having some issues because of the few gig I had left on the drive.  I purchased an SDXC card to tide me over but I figured eventually I would need to get a bigger drive.  I did research and this one seems to be the best M.2 drive by far (unless you can use a PCI card).  It is almost twice the size of the drive I had.  The reviews on Amazon were good.  So I waited until it reached a price point I felt I could warrant and then I purchased it.  I got it late a couple of nights ago.  I'm sure I spent well under an hour on this before it was in the laptop and working.  That includes putting it in an enclosure, cloning the old hard drive to it and then installing it in the laptop.  It was possibly one of the easiest things I've ever done on a computer.  And, low and behold I have gained about a 100 gig of storage space.  I have not run any speed programs on this because frankly speed was not an issue for me.  I knew it would be as good and probably better than the one I had and the one I had was fast enough.  This one feels a bit faster but i can't say it blows me away.  But, as I said, I wasn't looking for speed as much as for extra space.

If yours are wired, you can wrap the wire around the bottom to keep it out of the way. The stand looks great on a desk or counter as well. The base is just big enough to provide stability for most headphones as long as they are placed balanced in the middle.

1939324,1.0,"I highly recommend this product in the Northwest Indiana/Southwest Michigan area if two conditions are met.  1. You are near Lake Michigan and 2. The antenna is installed at a high up location.  I was very upset when Comcast started encrypting local over the air channels.  I decided to give an antenna a whirl since I am rarely home and not a big TV watcher.  I am about .6 of a mile from Lake Michigan making Chicago about 34.6 miles from me as the crow flies.  I have a wooded area between me and the lake.  I was only able to receive about 8 channels.  I then took it to my friend's home.  He is 400 feet from the lake.  We installed in in his upstairs bedroom that faces Chicago.  I performed a channel scan and immediately the tuner started locating channels!  He ended up with over 20 channels!  They were all clear and crisp and in HD!  Unfortunately I have to return this antennae for a amplified powered one, but if you live within the range this is the antenna for you.  I am still giving it 5 stars despite in not working for me since I saw it work in action!"

As a tech-savvy engineer, I generally purchase top-the-line laptops and accessories. Moreover, I have hands-on experience with computer repair and board level electronics. Two batteries (original and replacement) from this supplier were defective and/or improperly designed.  More alarmingly, they appear to have damaged my 2,500 dollar XPS laptop.  In short, the batteries would cause abrupt computer shut-downs without any warning.  The first battery would reach about 35%-45% level and the computer would shut down without warning. Restarting the computer would indicate 1% charge.  Even more ridiculous was the the second battery.  It would lead to computer shutdowns as high as 85%.  Of the 30 or so laptop batteries, I have had over the years, nothing like this has ever occurred.

Worst of all, after this happened about 25 times, my computer is damaged and is totally unresponsive. It is appears that a board-level failure has occurred.  Even more odd, is that have always avoided running on battery power, including with this 17 inch XPS when in possession of these new batteries.  Recently, I have to travel and been unable to have an AC outlet in reach. There is sufficient evidence to suggest serious problems with this supplier and this particular battery."

It has a magnetic force that keeps it closed and prevents the cover from being easily opened and protects the kindle screen nicely.  The look and feel of the case is great.  Definitely worth the money and more."
2892773,1.0,"I recently upgraded from the SX30 for the greater zoom, and also bought a T3i DSLR.  I wasn't crazy about the SX30 because of some yellow tint in some photos, which I now realize was probably due to white balance issues.

So let's talk about zoom.  I compared the zoom on this little baby to my DSLR with a 100-400 mm DSLR lens with a 2 x extender, about $2,000 worth of lenses.  Well, I found the SX50 actually took a sharper picture, and this is in a very low light environment.

I could not be more impressed.  Go Canon!  It makes me wonder why I bothered investing thousands of dollars into my DSLR and associated lenses."

292225,0.0,"I bought these when my original iPod headphones jammed in a gym locker and broke, thinking they would be an improvement. They miss being useful in the gym in many ways. The cord is very short. In addition the cords going to each individual earphone are unequal, they are not the same length where they join together. If you're going to attach it to your mp3 that attaches to your right arm it would probably be OK. However, if you attach it anywhere else it constantly gets pulled out of your ear. Because the entire wire is very short, Sony gives you an extension cord. This jack creates more weight that tends to pull the phones out of your left ear. If you jam them deep into your ear the sound is excellent. However, the moment they move a bit out, and they will, the bass diminishes considerably. I don't recommend them. In fact I feel that I threw out my money and will try to find the original iPod phones somewhere."

I have no idea why that other reviewer says it reverses, unless he was measuring for polarity using an audio device that was connected to it and the device itself was internally wired in reversed polarity.  I once tested a high end piece of equipment and found that the component itself was wired in reverse polarity.  That might be the case.  This adapter looks very well made.

The subwoofer is balance SO well...to me, eh, I like resonance, or 'boomy' systems rather than punchy and precise system. This system does a good amount of both, providing a very well balanced take to bass (hence the THX certification). I can't really turn my system's bass up above 30% without them complaining.

But wait! There's more...Those component speakers...hmm, while sounding great, they lack mids in my opinion. The bass is booming, the symbols are clashing, but, it is lacking that mid power. Nonetheless, 5 stars for being a very well rounded system that DOES NOT REQUIRE A RECEIVER!! WOOOO!"

It loaded just fine, in fact I thought it went rather fast, but then I set it up. It's SLOWWWWWW, and I don't mean just to start up. I changed the batteries in the remote... TWICE because I didn't want to believe that such a simple device could be bogged down navigating 4 option menus.

So far I've tested the most basic things like using a flash drive with my smart phone and tablet, and I also tested a USB mouse with my tablet, but I can't begin to imagine what else might possibly work! I have a handheld keyboard that I use for my media center that I can now use with my smart phone and table, maybe even use it as a remote control to play smartphone games with; I'll test it and update my review if it turns out not to work. But overall I'm very happy I found this, and at such a good deal on Amazon too, considering I came across this by chance while shopping around; it's something I've never seen in stores before, so when I saw it I just had to order it. Highly recommended! I did receive this product at no or a discounted cost in exchange for an honest review, but I was not compensated or instructed to leave a positive review; the opinion stated is that of my own. I hope my details provided illustrate that I honestly enjoy this product and take pride in helping with an accurate, unbiased review."

861916,0.0,when I first put it on my 5D Markiii it seemed fine. didn't block any buttons just the battery slot. easy to remove off the camera. BUT I PUT IT ON MY MONOPOD AND COULDNT TAKE IT OFF. Had to take the whole strap off my camera and still haven't been able to use my monopod. when trying to take it off my monopod it broke on me with it still being attached to the monopod. lasted one day. If you're going to buy a strap don't try and go the cheap route is all I advice.

1757072,1.0,"Very well made.  Comes in a wide variety of sizes.  Opening and closing the case is pretty convenient:  I find it preferable to drawstring closures found on most other neoprene lens cases. My only issue is that the single thickness of neoprene does not provide as much protection against intrusion from adjacent pieces of equipment as I'd like.  Indeed, I dearly miss the fitted hard cases that used to come with lenses."

1585565,1.0,"I gave it five stars because of the the price and it being short throw. But it is missing some features that the non short trows have, witch might make them a better option for many people. It doesn't have a zoom lens or horizontal keystone. Which means the projector most be placed perfectly center and square of where the screen will be. The no zoom lens means you will have to place it at the perfect distance to make the size image for your screen. That all makes it more difficult to mount. You can't just throw it on a shelf at the back of the room, the short trow will have you throwing a 250"" screen that far away. It has to be mounted in just the right spot in the middle of the ceiling, and the studs in the ceiling way not be on board with that plan. It's great for taking places and dropping it on a coffee table. If you want to mount it try Vantage Point CGUPM12 it's got a really adjustable arm, it worked for me. For the screen I went with a vinyl panel sold in home depots on the west coast only. It was highly raved about all over the internet cost 20 bucks and the perfect size for a just over 100 inch image.

2147913,0.0,"I have a second unit that died with the same symptoms as the 1st one. Gradually your WiFi connection degrades, at first you can't watch HD content and UI gets slower and slower, then starting streaming takes forever and you are stuck with the lowest video quality, and at the very end Roku can't even connect to a wireless network at all. Roku's forums are flooded with reports of this issue but the company's simply ignoring it and recommending to buy a newer version of the device. I was lucky that the 1st player has died in its warranty period, but the replacement player has died a week after its warranty expired. And 3 months warranty is a joke really. Contacted their support and the best solution they could come up was to change the wireless channel - what a nonsense. Now Roku never updates its firmware and just release a new version of the player instead, I guess it the way to motivate you to buy the new model. Well, for me this was my last Roku product I ever bought.

Bottom line: Not reliable, hardware has a fatal issue with WiFi chipset that causes the wireless connection degradation right after the warranty expires (approx. 3 months), firmware is never updated so you are forced to buy a newer version over time."

4793299,1.0,"This monitor gives stunning resolution and graphics, at a great size. I connect it with an HDMI cable to my laptop without issue (it doesn't come with an HDMI, but they are cheap enough these days to get!). The box contains a DP cable, but do know that if your laptop doesn't have a port for that, an HDMI cable also gives excellent picture quality.

A stand is included which is super easy to attach to the monitor with no screws required. I also love the fact the stand also accomodates vertical or horizontal configuration. When I have a long document to work on, it's easier to see more on the screen vertically rather than needing to scroll horiziontally. You can also adjust the angle the screen projects, as well as how high or low it sits. The various options make this perfect for any workspace.

Set up was as simple as can be. I just plugged the HDMI cable into my laptop and the monitor, adjust the input setting on the monitor with the buttons on the side of the screen, and done. Though it comes with a disc, I didn't need it. With the flat screen monitor, and the streamlined stand, it doesn't take up excess space on your desk either.

Both for gaming and watching movies, the graphics on this screen are superb. While my laptop is a gaming laptop, it's great to connect to thie monitor for a bigger picture, and I don't experience any lagging on either end."

5872171,1.0,"I have not racked up many miles on this yet so I'm hesitant to speak, but so far in its limited usage, I am impressed.  First of all, the machining and anodizing of the aluminum is just great, I can find no fault.  Add two levels, one of which is admittedly concealed by a mounted camera, and a third one on my tripod, and I think there is enough.  The quick release isn't Bogen/Manfrotto fast (did I just date myself?) but it is fast enough, and maybe more secure (than my old Bogen/Manfrotto-there I go again).  Screwed atop an Induro carbon fiber tripod it seems a perfect combination for most of what I use it for.  I also like the ball head tension provision within the locking knob.  Great!  And the small but significant safety pin with the spring loaded button for retraction is a really nice feature, not found in the same manner on at least one lesser SIRUI ball head.  Price wise, I think this ball head is a bargain.  Adhering to the bigger is better when it comes to, uh, ballheads, this is a great compromise size.  I don't care for smaller, and admittedly my dream ballhead is a RRS contraption that just looking at causes drooling, but for everything else, perhaps even price notwithstanding, this is a great camera mount in my opinion.  I say buy it!"

Another thing that I was dissapointed is that it cannot get power charged  and to be used at the same time, so when your battery is dead you need to stop using this mouse at all.

To give an example of what I use it for, I play Skyrim, Test Drive Unlimited 2, CS:GO/Source/1.6, Diablo 3, WoW, Hitman Contracts/Blood Money, Cities Skylines, Planet Side 2 and Battlefield 4.  I have not had any problems playing any games with this keyboard or mouse.  I love the DPI modes on this thing.  Gives me the slow feel I need when I am working on projects and the fast settings I need when I am trying to snipe in CS:GO.  If this thing goes with your color scheme then I'd suggest throwing it in your list unless you NEED a mechanical keyboard for your hardcore gaming needs.

Pros - Light, very well built, bright, easy to clean, very responsive and durable.

Cons - None really.  The only thing I could say is that if it doesn't match your color scheme then it won't be too useful but they come in different colors and Cooler Master also makes a keyboard that can suit almost any color scheme anyway!

All in all, I am happy with this combo.  It works great, fits what I needed it for and is just a great overall combo.  Would definitely buy another one if the need came up."

The drive case looked real nice except it is made out of that kind of black plastic that almost has a gray sheen to it that absorbs fingerprint oils. IOW, it looks filthy the second you touch it and the fingerprints cannot be wiped or even rubbed off. The plastic absorbs the oil and you need to use a microfiber cloth or some other very soft material sprayed lightly with 50/50 mixture of distilled water/vinegar. (Other cleaners might work but vinegar and water are safest in terms of not burning/clouding the plastic finish.)

I would have been happy to live with fingerprints, however, but the drive could not be recognized by my system - an Acer 4530 laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, fully patched.

1695207,1.0,"Works great so far. Produces a significant breeze for such a small item. At most of the variable speeds the dial allows, the fan is virtually silent. At the top speed there is only a still quite quiet whirring from the fan blades. I have the fan on a small desk and have it pointed to blow across the ventilation points of a Surface Pro 3. I use the fan when doing sustained work that is particularly taxing to the computer's graphical capabilities. Typically, during this work the top right of the device (where the gpu is located) will grow significantly hot and the computer will throttle down the device's capabilities to prevent overheating and damage. With the fan, that section stays cool and (judging by the sustained high performance) throttling doesn't occur. I have the fan plugged into a USB 3 hub which doesn't affect the fan's performance. When not doing work that is taxing on the computer I have the fan off or pointed at myself for a pleasant breeze."

Gee, I'd even give it 6 stars if I was not inconvenienced into having to take my AT out of its case in the dark at a Christmas concert. The camera at the back is partially obstructed by the case so all you'd have is a circle within your camera range. I had to hold my AT in an uncomfortable way throughout the recording instead of positioning it strategically & enjoying the concert as I had planned(I was in the front row). I went home & checked. The AT was aligned correctly to the case. Everything else is fine - slots wise. Overall, great case unless you use the back camera often.

334271,1.0,"Overpriced? Sure.

Useful? Of course, and in several ways. On a recent vacanza a Italia, the hood proved its worth not only as an excellent flare mitigator, but protected the front elements from damage (and I generally consider my gear babied) made possible by careless other tourists. Of course, the hood was a necessity during lengthy evening/night exposures, as well, in heavily traveled areas (Spanish Steps) because of the large doses of light provided streetlamps.

A slotted hood might ultimately provide better flare oblation across the entire zoom range, but this hood does its job.

For those who wonder, the hood works with both the DO and non-DO 70-300mm lenses.

For the record, I won't drop the star rating because of an excessive price. Protect your kit - and your exposure plane: use a hood."

581598,0.0,"Our old Replay TV (Lifetime membership) is still working strong. The only problem with Replay TV is that it won't take a digital Qam signal (or any digital cable/OTA signal).  Our goal when buying this card was to timeshift the HD locals.

We tried intensively for four days using the enclosed software, BeyondTV and then SageTV. Although we are computer literate, we could not get this card or the programs to work correctly on XP Pro with AMD 64 x 2 5000 chip. The video card we have installed is also heavy duty.

My little Vizio TV received Qam with no effort and takes 2 minutes to scan. But this card,,,,ugh....took 60 minutes to scan for analog and Qam. We did have the cable split. We did everything right.... but it constantly froze or was unable to map correctly.

After a point we looked at ourselves and said...""All this work just to timeshift the locals on HD?""

Better to watch the shows on the internet. They are there 24/7 and its free.  Darn.  Tivo is also out of the running since it won't take Qam and map it correctly either.

I have to say that the engineering is just not there yet for what we wanted. Maybe in a year or two when the demand is there, Hauppauge will develop a better product.

Suddenly it loses internet connection.  Although devices can still connect to the WIFI, the router is unable to negotiate connection with the ISP.  Even though I have experience trouble shooting networking issues, the Netgear rep wanted me to go through the same process before issuing me a RMA, wasting more than an hour of my time.  Even by that point he wasn't finished; there were more hoops for me to jump through.  I just gave up by this point, there were too many hoops to jump through.  That's probably their strategy to minimize the number of RMA's they have to issue.  Most other companies will just believe you when you say you did the troubleshooting steps and confirm the product is defective and just issue a RMA.  Never buying Netgear again.  I just threw money away on this.  There are plenty of other choices in routers out there, equal or better than this crapware.

 I usual buy a subminiature toggle switch and dill a hole on the front of the enclosure opposite the mute button. It's a tight fit, but if you can find a subminiature SPST panel mount switch with a small enough body, you can make it work.

I typically need the kill switch in drive-thru's around areas with a lot automated door openers. Mute works, but sometimes the detector drops the signal or the signal drifts frequency enough just long enough for mute to open up again. Even the MAX will do this when the signal frequency drifts enough to fool the GPS lockout . Beats reaching for the detectors button, which you have to hold down for a second too.

Other than that, it's nice having a mute button close at hand and not having to reach for the detector and take my eyes off the road."

906970,1.0,"Siggy2321 From Ohio,This Boston Acoustics MCS 100 speaker package is an awesome deal and a steal at what is now $199.00.  This set -up at circuit city went for $599.00.  One day after being at Circuit City they droped the price down to $549.00.  I just want to say you are not going to find a set this cheap that has really great sound for the size and the price.  Granted the speakers fill my family roon with great sound even though for now I am using a Old Sony 5.1 100 watt receiver.  I reccomend the Onkyo Tx-606 series.  In my living room, my main room for my home theatre Im using an Onkyo receiver I bought back in 2002, and nothing beats the quality of sound it puts out.  Rating each speaker, be carefull how you set the 5 satelite speakers up as not to use bass through these speakers.  The speaker are mainly for treble and very low mid range speaker, but the sub-woofer will make up the difference.  The center channel puts out really great sound at a low decibel.  The sub-woofer does a good job,though it could do a little better job with the high frequencies, it still has enough good bass that sounds good and isn't to clanggy. This is definatly a great starter system or for a small to medium sized room, but once again i have a totally much more exspensive system in my living room.  Lastly, they say you get what you pay for, but this isn't the case, you should be charged with theft because this is a steal!!!!!!!!!!! Hope this review helps."

2206428,1.0,"Got this for a Christmas present and it exceeds my expectations. It dropped the temp on my XFX 6870 over 20 degrees Celsius. It used to idle at around 60 degrees and full load at around 85-90. Now with the Twin Turbo II Cooler attached it idles at between 35-40 and full load about 55-60 degrees Celsius. Only negative things I could possibly say about it is that the cooler is HUGE. My graphics card now takes up 3 slots. Also the instructions could bit confusing to some. Would definitely recommend to those that need a new cooling fan or for those that want to drop their graphics card temp down.

Pros:

Works well.
Nearly silent even at full load.
1 year warranty
Works with a wide array of graphics cards.
Affordable compared to water cooling.

Cons:
HUGE. My graphics card now takes up 3 slots.
Confusing directions.

I would rate this product 4 and 1/2 stars."
1016223,1.0,"Excellent case.  Purchased as of 01/27/2015 and it is the new updated dual latch design (I was hesitant at first, but glad I took the plunge).  As always, they are pretty small on the inside compared to the outside, but this case in general is very, very small (perfect for my application).  You could spend a few bucks more to get the larger 1150, but if you need this size, then only this will do!  Anyways, top notch and will purchase from pelican/amazon again!"

Pros: Amazing product! For such a low price, it's an amazing product. I've used it nonstop for quite a while now, and I've never had to change the battery. I think it goes to sleep if it's not in use, but the best part is that it wakes up immediately and without a lag time.

6135647,1.0,"Wow! I impressed by the solid construction of the motor on this thing. It has plenty of torque and is as smooth as butter. I bought this for use on my Celestron 130 SLT and it fit perfectly. There are two sets of instructions: 1. For Orion scopes, and 2. For rack and pinion focusers like what comes on the 130 SLT. Installation went without issue but take note that it takes some force to remove the knob from the focuser as it is glued on. I had to break the knob to get it off. Next slide the motor coupler on the focus shaft, then the motor on the coupler then the bracket to hold them all in place. Piece of cake. The motor is very smooth and I like the fact that you can adjust the focus speed. From fast speed to get it close to where you want it then dial it down to fine tune the focus. Now, as with the accufocus on my Celestron 8 SE, I can focus the scope without having to touch the focus knob alleviating the dreaded wobbles you get when touching the mount."

1171920,1.0,"Works great! I've got the HDD mounted and operational. Note; you'll need a power cable as this isn't provided. Instead Star Tech has provided a power split cable  so; the builder can with one lead from the PSU; split one SATA power lead into two. That's a very cool idea and they have created an extremely solid power splitting cable here. And, at just six inches long it won't take up a lot of space in the tower.
I like the fact that multiple mounting positions were provided for mounting the adapter into the tower so; I was able to mount this adapter in the tower with it sitting upright on my desk. Admittedly the ideal position for putting the screws in is flat on a table on a towel but I was feeling lazy and with the extra 1/2 inch of wiggle room I was able to pull it off just fine. My tower was a little on the inexpensive side and as such I didn't get a perfectly aligned back screw but it isn't coming back out without a fight and I'm confident I have it in there real tight."

Did the restart and got the message that drive was disconnected improperly, didn't think much about it, then a day or so later I went to access the drives and nothing, did a unplug and re-plug... nothing, turned off then on... nothing, then unplugged power and USB cable... nothing.

It wasn't the restart that caused it, only the thing that got my attention of a problem.

Then put my hand on the case and it was very very hot, unplugged again and pulled out a hard drive, it was too hot to hold in my bare hands.
It appears that the fan had failed and went into cooking mode.  Not sure if drives are damaged, I hope not as the two are over $400 and one less than three months old.

2072689,0.0,"Right off the bat my first one arrived extremely scratched up due to the poor packaging. My second one also had scratches, but was tolerable. Maybe I'm picky, but the whole point of this case is to have protection without covering up the Macbooks nice look.

For protection, it's not even that great. Oh sure, it will stop a foreign object from ruining your Macbook, but the case itself scratches. It's problem is it has a nice snug fit (probably to cut down on bulk), which initially sounds good. But the snug fit means that if you move your Macbook while the case is on, it rubs on the metal leaving marks. It also has several clips to keep it securely attached, Again a good idea, but the clips too leave marks.

My Macbook looks worse than ever thanks to this lousy case. I had to buy a new bottom cover for my Macbook (ok I didn't HAVE to, but it was all scratched up), but can't do anything about the marks left on the cover and sides other than pay Apple to fix it. Since this case doesn't protect against drops, there is simply no point in wasting money on it. If you want real protection, I suggest the Invisibleshield by Zagg, or a case with a rubber interior that doesn't cause damage.

It baffles me why it has gotten such good reviews. Perhaps people haven't checked under the cover to see the damage it did to their Macbooks."

Kudos to the designer,  this goes perfectly in our kitchen which has a retro-vibe and allows me to stream music off of my iPod, tablet, or iPhone as well as turn to my favorite radio station and listen to what is going on in our community.

Things I LOVE:
The Retro style of the streaming device
The super simple touch pairing that allows me to stream the MP3
Charging station for my phone/tablet

Pros

Cheap

Larger screen

Unlocked Android

Cameras are terrible. I tested Skype and it crashes constantly. The camera app displays upside down??? Strange.

Lags for almost everything. I watched her play a game and I wanted to break it myself.

Battery??  Does the battery even work...she played a game for 45 mins and it went from 100 percent to 16. That's unacceptable.

Slow to setup. I root and custom ROM phones and this thing was terrible to just setup.

I'm not gonna go on, but I want ppl to know that this inflated score is misleading. If you want a tablet to surf the web or ummmm do nothing...then buy it.

It also charges my iPhone 3G that ceased to work with my old charger after the most recent software update. Only downside is it's a bit tough to remove from the socket since there's so little excess material and it fits very tight. However, for me that's not an issue since I generally always leave it plugged in and like the fact that it's connected securely."
15446,1.0,"I was browsing Amazon for replacment pads for my MDR-V6 headphones when I was prompted that I had already purchased these headphones 7 years ago. So I decided to review them now. First, this is my second set of MDR-V6 headphones. The first pair I purchased in 1986. 26 years ago and I still have them. They still work and I only bought the second set because I stepped on my first set and it is taped together. Definately not for outside use. But hey, after 26 years on my first set and 7 on my second set with super-heavy use these are the best cans at any price. They sound great, they are light and comfy and are durable. They will take some time to ""burn-in"" but once they do they will sound great, a tad ""bright"" but great. They also take a sick amount of power! I have used both pairs to the extreme and they never once blew. Sometimes I just crank my stereo through these headphones and use them as speakers without fear of them blowing."

4126511,1.0,"Having been a computer professional for over 30 years (I have bought and set up literally hundreds of monitors for all types of use)  I can tell you that perception is relative.  What looks great to one person looks like crap to another.  To me the additional pixel count of the BenQ make the screen and all content I display on it look fantastic.  My games seem to have added depth that is noticeable and welcome.  The BenQ has a quality feel to it as well.  Nothing seems cheaply made.  I do not color calibrate my monitors (but I do tweak the color settings based on tech web site reviews) so my impression of the color is subjective.  To me the color is great.  There are plenty of adjustments if you need them to get it to your personal liking.  I have noticed no screen lag while playing games (Bioshock Infinite, Borderlands, Dragon Age Inquisition).
The only 'con' I can come up with is that the little remote menu controller is not easy to use.  It looks good and has a quality feel, but the buttons are jammed together with little difference in the feel of each button.  This almost requires you to look at the device each time you want to push a button which is somewhat of a pain when you are wading through the extensive set-up menu.  I really do not consider this major by any means.  I see no need to constantly adjust the monitor and once it is done, it is over.
I am really very pleased with this monitor.  I highly recommend it."

No problem with removal when he wants to clean inside the top and bottom cover and it prevents scratches and fingerprints on his chromebook (which he loves by the way).  Someone mentioned that there is only two tabs on the front part of the top cover and a third one is needed in the middle to prevent the cover from coming off when you open the tablet but we have not experienced this issue at all.  The cover stays on during use of the tablet without any problems with opening and closing the tablet.

This mCover should fit your Acer C270 or C720P nicely.  It should not be loose or come off when opening and closing.  If that is happening I believe that item to be defective and I recommend and exchange.

Thank you kindly."

2202654,0.0,"I do not normally do negative reviews but this merits it.  This worked for about 7 months.  Then I started having problems.  You cannot call Harmony for support you have to do everything online.  After getting the run around for 2 months - the tech support people said they would send a new charger...Although I did not think that was the problem.  After several more attempts to get warranty service the said I had to replace the battery so I paid for a new battery.  Just good money after bad.  It still did not work.  By this time I had gone beyond the warranty period (it should of been replaced when I first contacted them).  So I spent over $200 for a remote and over $25 for a battery I did not need.  Support from Logitech is just a delaying tactic until you are not eligible for support anymore.

The other cases I've bought stop before the wrist strap lugs, which is nice because I like to leave a wrist strap on it all the time for instances in which I'll take this type case completely off.  The upper half of this case is way too tall, it is a very poor fit.  I'm really disappointed in how poorly this item fits the camera.  I loan this camera out sometimes to friends, so I really need the protection, but this case is not worth the money.  I've gotten cheaper cases off EBay that fit much better."

o The documentation is a joke! The  ""manual"" is two pages long. And no, the product isn't intuitive  so you don't need a manual. Look forward to lots of trial and error as you  learn it yourself.

I've only ever owned one brand of the superior sound headphones so I don't know how qualified I am to judge but yikes these are terrible.  There was no depth, no bass and the volume was limited.  You could barely hear out of them.  Next the ear hooks made it impossible to put these on without stopping looking for the ""L"" and then fitting them into your ear after several tries to find the right direction and angle to fit in your ear.  After you did that, they did exactly what they were supposed to do and stayed in your ears.  That's the one star, they stay in your ear when you are in motion.

The leather, and the stitching is exquisite and it sits so comfortably on my head, for hours as I'm listening to music, or watching something on my laptop. They look and feel substantial but are surprisingly lightweight which is a huge plus as I wear headphones quite often. I'm no expert but the sound quality is wonderful. They aren't noise canceling, but they are pretty darn close. While listening to music I can hear every little nuance that I miss listening without headphones, or listening on awful speakers. It's all so clear and life-like that these have become my new favorite headphones, even given they're corded. These, in my opinion are fairly pricey and I would not recommend them for casual use.

3596278,0.0,Should have read the description more closely. I wanted to use this adapter to connect a second VGA monitor and audio output to the HDMI port of a Mac Mini. The location of the audio port on the side of the adapter didn't leave room to connect the audio cable when there is another cable plugged into the displayport. And the VGA monitor connected through this adapter flickered constantly and never achieved full resolution. I even tried using the VGA port on the HDMI monitor I was replacing with the same result. This device does not seem to support high enough resolution to work properly in a Mac Mini HDMI port.

Finally, I came across an article about the proper ergonomics of desk configurations. Turns out the monitors were too low and too far away. So, I set off in search of a solution.

Nikon D200 - was a great camera
Nikon D300s - was a fantastic camera and built very well. Nice grip etc. solid images
Nikon D700 - Needs no review, you shot with it, you know.
Nikon D3 - Tank and machine gun sports animal.
D4 - never had the pleasure
D800 - used a few times, files are great if you print on billboards.
Nikon D7000-7002, are you kidding? Tinker toys, images are great, performance reminds me of using a fisher price toy from my childhood.
I am no longer shooting professionally as much, so I want a solid camera for my part time habit. I find it shocking that we have to pay  1-2K for a toy. I love Nikon, always have. Please make a camera that stands up to the D300 in build quality and if possible, fits someone's hand larger than an infant.

Always and forever...

I was looking for a mount to fit my new Apple TV 4K that would hide the device behind the TV.  I have a recessed area so wall mounting in that area was fine.  This product fit the bill.  The mount is metal and quite sturdy.  It came with all the screws necessary for stud or drywall mounting, and I mounted mine in a stud.  It fits the Apple TV 4k perfectly and has slots to allow airflow along the bottom of the device for better ventilation.  Once mounted the product was very sturdy and secure.  If you're looking for a wall-mount for the ATV4K this is a great option."

My old camera was really bulky so that is why i purchased this cybershot. It fits just about anywhere and i love how lightweight it is also. Perfect for travel!

My old digital camera didn't have all these fancy features that this sony offers which is probably why most users aren't getting the perfect photos on the first try. Its been two weeks and i have discovered exactly how to get the quality photos i am used to. Now that i know how to use the features properly i am extremely happy with my purchase. While there are many things that might contribute to the grainy photo issue that i have read from other reviewers, i think one solution might be to lower the photo size settings to the 4x7/5x7 setting (unless you are wanting to print out something larger).
Overall, very happy with this product."

-Very useful.
-Bounces the on-flash light.
-Lightweight.
-Sturdy construction.
-Not flimsy. The plastic feels nice and thick.
-Fairly good in size. (I thought it was smaller.)
-Comes with a small black drawstring pouch for storage.

Cons:
-Bulky. It won't really fit in my camera bag.
-The black drawstring pouch isn't as good in quality as the Lightscoop itself. The pouch seems to be good for keeping dust off of it.

I wasn't impressed with simply diffusing my pop-up flash so I bought a Lightscoop. Really, the light from this is nice. I am able to place this on my hotshoe and it doesn't look funny compared to other diffusing methods I've used. When I want to keep ""low key"" at a gathering or not bring my big strobe, I'll use this. People seem to find the pictures more pleasing that what they're used to with only using the harsh on-camera flash.

I've also followed the instructions and have been to the flickr group site for techniques and even some inspiration.

This is a fun product and experimenting with the light/reflectors/mirrors/walls give you different effects. Whatever you do, the results are fantastic."
458228,0.0,"I'm sold on DLP technology and own other DLP TVs.  I thought replacing the projector lamp in this TV with a cool, quiet, long lived LED cluster would just make a DLP TV that much better...but apparently not.  After about 2 weeks the picture went all red which cycled to green and then went black.  Currently awaiting a Samsung recommended repairman to visit next week.  Hopefully it will be something simple.  I still believe that DLP is the best TV technology available today and replacing a bulb, fan and color wheel with a LED cluster is still a great idea but poor execution on Samsung's part.  After the repair and some use I'll report back with another review.

REVISED REPORT...The repairman called back and said he was ordering the parts and would call to schedule an appointment when he got the parts.  Samsung obviously must know what the problem is since they did not even need to examine the TV to order the parts.  The repairman called several days later and had the parts, then came out and installed a new LED module and the TV works as good as new, actually better than new since it didn't work very well when it was new.  It's been a few weeks now and all seems well but I guess time will tell.  If it should fail in the future you can be sure I'll report it here."

These sound like complete crud. They have NO deep range and were hurting (piercing high ranges, not physical ear irritation) my ears at work after a few hours. I had to resort to dropping the last 3 channels of my MP3 players Eq settings to the bottom of the slide range to make my ears stop ringing.

I would expect from some dollar store junk, not $40 headphones. That things like these exist only promotes the idea that there are still people who so image conscious that they are willing to suffer (literally) to look cool!

My husband and I basically just follow the kids around all day, so I don't have to worry about what to do with it while we are there. I'm always with it.

The bag itself is well made. All the zippers worked well. The shoulder pads are padded, so I don't end up with sore shoulders after lugging this around with me all day. It's very spacious, so that allows me to bring a lot of stuff. The extra pockets make it easy to store things separately. I can put things like sunscreen in the front, so it's not only easy to get to, I don't have to worry about it getting on the clothes.

There is very slight seam, which is to be expected when buying ""cheap"""" crystal. The way it is positioned, along with the pattern on the glass, makes it barely noticeable. You will only see it if you really search for it.

Picture quality is excellent and I haven't noticed the rainbow effect that some people see on DLP projectors.
Very easy to set up and the default settings are already very good.
It is a short throw projector which means you can place it close to your screen or wall yet get a big picture.
This projector have lots of inputs so you can connect your blue ray, PC and other devices.
On the minus side: it has only one 3.5mm audio out.  If you have a self contained powered 5.1 or 7.1 surround speakers,
you can't get a true surround sound using only the 3.5mm stereo out.  I wish they put in an optical Toslink, Coax or HDMI audio out.

I paired this with my adobe apps and Procreate and it works flawlessly on my iPad Air 2. Charges quickly. I would baby this stylus though -- you wouldn't drop any other piece of Bluetooth equipment with sensitivity. You shouldn't just throw it in your bag or in a pen case with other writing implements.

The biggest flaw is that it never shows up under the Bluetooth menu to connect like the instructions say it will, just pair in app, under settings for most apps.

Don't blame the pen if you don't have your brushes set up correctly to draw the kind of lines you want. If you've ever used illustrator and a Wacom tablet, you will probably be able to handle this just fine. If you haven't, there's going to be a learning curve.

I haven't figured out the palm settings yet, but I have a case on the iPad I'm using to draw and it keeps my palm off the screen which helps.

Unless you're an audiophile who demands massive and impressive sound at all times, this sounds excellent for the type and size of speaker.  I'd be careful not to play it at the highest volume,  as some reviewers have said they blew the speaker.

I had some problems with my Lenovo dropping connection periodically. In the few weeks I've had this mouse, it's stayed connected 100% of the time. The Lenovo was very comfortable in my hand from the start. This mouse is taking some getting used to, but the more I use it, the more I proficient I become with it. I have average-sized hands and meaty fingers, and I was afraid that the buttons were going to be too close together at first, but I'm getting the feel for it now. The laser has tracked flawlessly on every surface I've tried it on so far (including wooden & metal desks, leather pad, piece of paper, my pants leg, etc).

But the Durcell 2050mAh's had a noticeably shorter life span than the Sony 2100mAh rechargeables.  After around 100 pictures, the Duracells were down to a quarter charge left (using a Sony W5 digital camera).  But the Sony still had 3 quarter.  The Duracells will now be relegated to powering my cheapo Colgate spin toothbrush.  I won't trust them to taking photos.

Oh yes, I remembered another.  I was overseas.  Went with one pair of Duracells for 5 days or so.  Had another pair of Duracells and a pair of Sonys that came with my camera in the bag as backup.  When I needed the backup, the Duracells were pretty much drained after 5 days of non-usage, while the Sony's were 3/4 charged.

So, I haven't used these Sony 2500mAh I'm purchasing, but would expect even better performance than the 2100mAh's.  Will update when I get them and use them.

so if you are an amateur, pro, or you want to learn more about photography i think this camera will help you, has a lot of manual settings... and 30 x zoom! perfect for baseball, soccer games... to make a movie zooming the players, taking moon photos.

However, the drive has failed three times already and it's only 42 days old.  Each time, the Apple Disk Utility was not able to repair and required a full re-format/re-partition of the drive.  Thanks to a good set of backup from Time Machine, I can usually get it back running in about 3 hours or so.

As this is my primary computer, this repeated failure is unacceptable.  If you don't regularly backup your computer or need a reliable computer, STAY AWAY from this drive.

I've already opened a RMA with Kingston, so hopefully a replacement drive will be better.  However, from reading other complaints, I doubt it.

Update:
I got an advanced exchange RMA from Kingston.  After just over two weeks of using the new drive, I had to go through the Reformat/Re-partition fun again.  Either these drives are not compatible with the Core i7 MBP and Kingston doesn't tell me about it... or they're just awfully UNRELIABLE!  Definitely stay away!!!"

They are much bulkier than the ear buds I previously used but I would not go back to using the ear buds when flying or in any environment where there is a lot of background noise. With these I was much more relaxed on the flight.

Next week I am having surgery to try to fix problems with my right thumb. Can I say the problem was 100% this mouse, no. But I can say without any doubt that this mouse was a major contributing factor to the problems I am having. I gave up on this mouse when the pain started to become unrelenting. After doing some research I chose an Evoluent mouse. I am very happy with that choice. I work for a large company that employs several people full time to help with Ergonomic issues. The expert I consulted with reinforced my choice when she told me that the Evoluent was the mouse they recommended and purchased for me to use at work. Her professional opinion was that a trackball mouse is ergonomic bad news because the thumb is designed for gripping not for fine motor skills needed for mousing.

5605076,0.0,"I've been a Roku fan for a while - I've owned the 1, 2 and 3 (and 4, this one) - all of them were increasing better in quality and functionality except the 4.

I loved the Roku 3 - it was awesome. So when i lost my remote and saw that there was a 4 out, I trusted Roku to have another great device and made the plunge.

It's much larger than the 3, which was fine because it sits behind the tv anyway. But looks like the hardware only got worse with the large size. It constantly crashes. Sometimes the screen just doesn't show up after reboot or crash. Even after several tries. The issue could be the heat - because the Roku 4 gets burning hot.
The crash is usually not a quick crash-reboot either - first the audio disappears, then video goes black. Stays like that for long (remote does not respond at this point). Then it goes to reboot. Sometimes it doesnt even - just powers off. And i have to manually reboot. I did not notice a huge difference in quality over Roku 3. I'm thinking of just returning this and buying a new remote for my 3 instead.

Performance has gotten worser and crashes more frequent. Sometimes it just stops working and refuses to connect. Very bad product from Roku"

Unusable.  I have long been a proponent of using outdoor antennas, and this product did nothing to prove to me otherwise.  I tried everything imaginable: mounting in all different directions, even mounting it on windows facing directly to the broadcast antennas.  Nothing worked.  I tried it on another set, and it did not work there either.  I had the same reception on both using an old FM radio ""loop"" antenna I got for free with an AM/FM tuner 15 years ago, and that one is not even optimized for UHF frequencies.

The only thing I couldn't find in the directions but discovered later with an online search was how to PROGRAM THE REMOTE TO MY TV. You don't need codes and I spent several minutes entering codes before I discovered none of them worked. All you have to do is press the TV ""on/off"" button and the ""Red"" button at the same time for a couple of seconds and voila! I'm not sure if that will work for every TV but it worked for my old LG."

6720477,0.0,"If I had written a review 3 weeks ago it would have been 5 stars.  Worked perfectly at first, exactly as described.  Now it's completely unreliable.

Sometimes it will boot without recording.
Sometimes it will get locked on the boot screen and the power button doesn't work.
Sometimes it just won't power on at all.

We have done a factory reset on it, and that didn't fix the problem.  New SD card.. still nope.

My husband just came in and flatly informed me ""dash cam's dead.""  So I guess that's it!

I thought I was getting a great deal, but buy with caution as you may wind up with a lemon on this one..  I would not recommend purchasing it.  If you're reading 5* reviews, check to see how long the person has been using it.  Like I said, if I had reviewed this right out of the box or even after a few weeks driving, I would've given it 5* too."
6541481,0.0,"i bought this for an older machine which all of the specs claimed it would be compatible with.
It made my machine crash non-stop.
I spent hours on tech support with the manufacturer.
Spent $40 shipping the part back for a replacement.
It still crashed.
Spent another 4 hours on phone with tech support.
Finally got escalated to level where someone figured out that even though my machine model was supposed to be compatible and had more than ample ram, processor speed etc, that my motherboard was 3 months too old to play nice with this unit.
I'm out the full cost of the card, plus the shipping fee for the replacement and a lot of wasted time and computer crashing.
I guess i could try to sell it on ebay but that would be more wasted time and not worth the bother.
I know this kind of hassle is always a risk with upgrading older gear, so i'm just venting."

5267394,1.0,Works well in my GoPro hero4 silver and session. No problems so far.
2359520,1.0,"Pro's:
-Great sound, music is clear and nothing is overemphasised (like bass).
-Great build quality, it uses metal instead of just plastic like most of these other headphones. Really makes it seem stronger.
-Love the folding mechanism. Bends with ease and just is a smooth process; unlike some other headphones i've had where its a rough bend.
-Also love design/placement of the various buttons; it's very intuitive. The power/phone button and play/pause buttons are located directly on the opposite side of the earbuds (if you look at the picture its the black circle with the 'creative' logo). Easy to press and big. The volume up/down and next/prev track are right on the edge of that circle. The volumes are simple buttons, but relatively big and easy to locate. The next/prev track is a slider type button. I.e you move the slider up and next track and vice-versa. It works quite nicely and i like it.
-Nice job of sound isolation.

Con's:
-Only thing is the earbuds are slightly small. They are soft and comfortable though.

Depends:
-As with other creative products in this line, there is no power adapter... you must charge via usb cable.

To summarize, i loved these headphones. If you don't mind the price, i highly doubt you will regret the purchase. As with all bluetooth headphones though make sure you check your phone's bluetooth profiles and make sure it has support for the ones this has (a2dp specifically)"

728274,0.0,"Second Review:
Update 10/15/2008 - after receiving my first replacement set in 8/2008 on October 6, 2008 the left channel failed. V-Moda is sending a new pair but I must say I'm disappointed that I have had to pay for each shipment to V-Moda at a total cost of about 7.50 X 2. I have spent nearly 15% of the cost of the unit returning them for replacements, not including my time & gas going to UPS. I must agree with several others here that when they work, they're wonderful. If the next unit fails I will push V-Moda for a refund. The two sets I've had seem to last 60 days or so then go out. If I could re-rate these I would give them 2 stars because of the problems.

First Review:
I bought these for my my wife in June 2008 for her IPhone. They worked fine for about 60 days and then the sound became distorted. Songs sounded as if they where in a echo chamber.
Sent the unit back to V-Moda and they sent back a new V-Moda Duo with one slight change, there was a upgrade to the male jack that attaches to the Iphone. Much sturdier ""Y"" shaped jack that helps you to resist the temptation to pull the cord (instead of the jack) when you disconnect the from your unit.
Sound is wonderful. If this unit fails I will update, but I believe these are a keeper.

Third and final review:
I'm done with this product and V-Moda. They will not refund your money. They know the product is defective and fails like clockwork (about every 45-60 days). Don't waste your time, effort, and money as I have done."

It barely produces a clear enough signal to be audible (and that was trying with the many channels (both manual and automatic) designated as clear frequencies).  I am somewhat at a loss to explain why Microsoft would allow such a poor quality product to go out of the door with its' name on it.  To make matters worse, when you try to return the item using the Amazon return merchandise screen the option to select return reason is grayed out so that it is not possible to go forward with the return request.

Then I upgraded the router's firmware to its latest version; that didn't help either.

At first, I thought the issue had to do with my cable company, but after reverting to my original configuration (PC directly connected to the cable modem), the DHCP problems were solved. Checking in Netgear's forums and in some other sites around the Internet, I've found many customers with similar issues.

I decided to discontinue using the router, and to purchase a Linksys WRT54G, which has been working flawlessly.

2972485,0.0,"My wife went on a business trip to south-America visiting companies. She wrote all notes in the iPad. On her way back, the iPad spontaneously showed an error (without doing absolutely anything other than turn it on) ""This iPad is disabled"" and asked to wait for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes all was gone. It started as if the iPad was new. I went to the iPad store and they said that they don't know why this happened and that they have no way to recover any data. All was lost. The best they could do is to exchange it for a different one. The lost data was worth so much more than the iPad.
I think is unacceptable that this tablet may destroy the user's data and according to the Apple store employees, there's nothing wrong with it. If the operating system has a problem, user's data should not be deleted, even if it has to start cold.
This is the second iPad we have and the second to fail. The first one, a first generation, just stopped charging and we had to pay Apple to exchange it for a different one.
The lesson we learned is that this devices may be good for music, photos or any other unimportant tasks, but to me, they are toys.
I wouldn't rely on this tablet on anything important.

Update: It did it again. I went to an Apple store and they exchanged it. The employee at Apple said that they never saw this failure before. I hope the replaced unit works fine, but anyway we will just trust the important notes to pen and paper."

I then got on Amazon to replace them for a cost savings, and so I can return the overpriced ones to BB. I figured I would order the same exact ones since Cmple had the same make/model for a fraction of the BB price.  ($3.31 versus $29.99!!!)

I believe this is a bait and switch: the cables delivered are poor build quality, thinner gauge, have weak heads, and 1 of 3 is already going bad. They are not branded by Dynex.  They work, but they are not what is advertised here.  Let me be clear:  I had (3) Dynex DX-AV002 cables in my possession when I received my order from Cmple.  They are undoubtedly NOT what the site claims them to be.

If they weren't so cheap I'd raise hell.

On a separate note, ""real"" Dynex DX-AV002 HDMI cables are great high-speed HDMI cables, made well, and work w/o issue with 3D.  Its a shame that the real ones have to get negative reviews due to Cmple's dishonest practices.  Needless to say Cmple will never get any of my money.

I purchased a new item, and seem to have received a used product.

Well, VCT sent me the Taiwanese model (packed upside-down in the box, for good measure) and the Taiwanese model will not play other regions.

Avoid this seller like grim death. Even if your order is fulfilled by Amazon, avoid VCT. You are sure to get something defective. I have ordered three DVD players from them and all were defective.

When you see ""VCT,"" run for the hills.

Incientally, in response to my letter of complaint Pioneer responded with a disingenuous, self-serving letter saying that they never claimed the player could play all-region, much less blu-ray, in overt contradiction to the claims made on the box and the reviews on Amazon. They say the manual makes no reference to blu-ray or to all-region. Well, I have eyesight. The box and the manual were covered with claims that the blu-ray player would play all-region.

So Pioneer is as bad as VCT. They make deceptive claims about their products, and lie to the disappointed customer."

Before it broke, it would hardly ever work.

Any change to any setting in the thing would require the router to reboot to apply. This process made setting up the device extremely time consuming. Every little click in the web management interface would reboot the thing!

When it finally was up and running, connection problems were immediate. Hardly any of my devices could maintain a connection longer than 30 minutes. Sometimes connections would outright die in the middle of a transfer. I have about eight different wifi devices and this dang thing wouldn't work with any of them reliably.

Netgear has a strange idea of what ""functional"" means when it comes to their wireless routers of this generation and prior. Perhaps they've cleaned up their act, but I don't care. I felt completely punked by this product.

(For what it's worth, I now use a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 with the open-source DD-WRT firmware. It's not ""wireless N"" but the router has not needed a reboot in over nine months and my stuff ALWAYS connects and STAYS connected...)"

There are 3 lots for USB and I have 3 different usb charging cords plugged into it- one iPad connector, one MicroB cord (standard type for non-Apple smartphones and other thin/small devices) one for MiniB (I have two Garmin GPS devices that take these).  It's pretty handy to have all the cords there ready to go instead of having to unplug and plug in various boxes into the outlet.

I like that it is not sucking power when it is plugged in but not charging, unlike the individual adapter plugs that I used to leave in the wall when not being used. The only thing is that you have to learn to remember to hit the Power button when you plug something in for it to charge. Otherwise, when you get up in the morning you will be sad when you realize you didn't charge your iPad after all. The power shuts off on its own after 6 hours.

The only think I don't like about this unit is that the cord to the unit itself is really thick, sort of long and unsightly because I have it on a countertop where there is no place to hide the cord. If it were on a piece of furniture where you could tuck the cord behind it wouldn't bother me. Not a dealbreaker or anything, just a minor eyesore."

One problem I found (for me) is when zoomed out fully and then you later want to print a 8X10, the finer details will be pixelated but not noticeable with 4x6 prints. However, in fairness, this could be an IS issue at full zoom(?) or photographer (me) trying to do too much image correction. Will have to try more 8X10's with no zooming or image correction. Megapixel size should be enough for 8x10's so not sure what problem might be (and, yes, image quality is set to maximum in menu)."

I tested 2 routers tonight, WRT54GL and Netgear R7000. Believe me, you cannot believe.:)

They are at the same place, exactly, and the same client, Samsung S3 mini with Speedtestet.net at same positions inside house and outside.
The first: 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz for R7000:
5GHz cannot pass through 4 wooden walls. Network is not available.:)
There is logic, because short radio waves can go through more than ultra short waves.
So, we now speak about 2.4Ghz, 5GHz is not important so much, just a little bit quality -  short distance(audio quality at ultra short waves  vs short waves  :)).

54GL has the same range and better Wi-Fi stability than R7000.

So, if you have download speed no more than 50Gb/s and not so much Wi-Fi clients do not waste your money and time. Go for 54GL.
Else...you know...a lot of money for multi clients.:)

It makes a 24 mm eyepiece act as a 12 mm eyepiece and so forth but with the same field of view. It essentially doubles your eyepiece collection for any astronomer because every eyepiece can now be used at two magnifications (the original and with the Barlow, at twice that magnification). I do not have the expertise to judge the quality of the lens used in this Barlow but it does work well with my stock Orion eyepieces.

I then purchased a Cruzerlite case and that was okay but more expensive. Nothing that instilled any reaction in me. It just did its job albeit it is a fingerprint magnet. Wish the entire case were matte.

This ProCase is very good in my opinion. While the price is cheap, the build is not. I really like that it has the wake sleep feature and that it works well. I also really like that it has elastic that holds the flap in place for when you hold the device by the strap. It feels sturdy and comfortable. Unlike the SuperCase that felt flimsy. I also like the grooves it has to hold your device in landscape mode. I am a little worried about the locking mechanism though. Since it brushes against the bezel, I am worried about wear or discoloration.

Lastly, I do love the color. While my favorite color is black, this one stands out more and is more visible in the dark. Not to mention it distinguishes the Nexus 7 from all the other devices I have.  If it had a black strap, it would totally have the Game of Death jumpsuit look. Yes, I am a total geek."

Unlike the ""five in one"" memory card readers we're so used to from laptops and whatnot, this is a six-in-six reader... meaning all six types of cards supported have their own distinct slots, and you could theoretically use several at once.

I used it once last week.  Everything was fine.  I really liked how it distributed the weight of the two 5D bodies with the lenses on.  It was a lot more comfortable than using two Black Rapid straps separately.

THEN THE NIGHTMARE HAPPENED TODAY (3/26/2013)!

In the middle of a pregnancy shoot at my client's home, the carabiner hook BROKE (see posted picture on Amazon from me).  My 5D mark III + my brand new 24-70mm f/2.8 mark II lens + Pocket Wizard TT5 just fell on the floor.  My heart almost stopped.  I wasn't even doing anything with any impact at the time.  All I did was bending down lower, and I heard this big thump!

My pocket wizard has a broken hot shoe for sure.  I don't know the extent of my lens or camera damage.  It makes me sick to think that I just risked $6000 worth of equipment on this piece of crappy product!  I don't know if I can sleep tonight.

I did plug it in to my Samsung edge 6 but it needs to also be connected to a USB port in addition to the hone and projector to provide the power required. That's not really what I would call portable. More like useless, to me. Even after I did plug all 3 in I could not get a video to stream to the projector.

1874391,0.0,"This adapter does not work properly with the Nvidia Shield.  I tried using the adapter to convert my Nvidia Shield's HDMI 2.0 output to a DisplayPort 1.2 input into my 4K monitor.  The DP 1.2 port is fully compliant with HDCP 2.2, so it should work, but it doesn't.  The Shield only shows regular HD as available through the Netflix app.  I have tried switching the USB power dongle from the Nvidia Shield to another USB port on my monitor to provide the power for the active adapter, but to no avail.  My only conclusion is that the adapter is somehow blocking the HDCP 2.2 signal from getting to or from the monitor's DP 1.2 port.  As a result, 4K playback on Netflix (and most likely Amazon Prime too) will not work.

Until this issue is resolved by Startech, my only option is to give this adapter 1-star as it does NOT work as advertised."

Pushed power, nothing.  Pushed power several times, and it came on.  A little noisy.  I tried the buttons on the front of the machine.  Nice, barely need to touch them, kinda neat.  Did not have a blu ray disc, so I threw in the new Star Trek movie, regular dvd.  Wow!  Non blu ray up converted to 1080p.  Awesome picture!!  Just spectacular!!  BUT...I could immediately see a lip sync issue. Speech was noticeably off.  In fight scenes, the sound of an impact, and the actual contact, were noticeably off.  Then, camera motion on scenes showed distortion, almost like seeing heat waves on pavement in the desert. Happened in several scenes. I have never seen that from my current hi def up converting Sony dvd player, or from any broadcast station. I never got it hooked up to the internet, so I never experienced the firmware update machine killer so many others talked about.  Needless to say, I drove straight back to the store and returned it.

Sandisk does not sell in bulk packaging for wholesalers to turn around and sell in their own packaging. I no longer buy any Sandisk product unless it comes in the retail packaging so I know its bonafide.

The set up was easy (although the registration process is a little confusing).  I signed up for the year's service and my phone worked and I was given a phone #.  The quality of the calls was not great, a fair amount of static, but acceptable.  All OK until I tried to add International credit.  Despite trying 2 credit cards it would not add credit.  Told me there was no phone # attached to my account when there was.  I talked to customer service via chat (you cannot call) for 6 days in a row where I was told I had to wait for engineer/billing to get in touch re: issue.  Same thing every time and I never heard a thing from them... After a week I decided to return the Magic Jack as it just doesn't work.  I have since set up Vonage.  It is a little more expensive but the call quality is so much better and I was able to dial internationally within minutes.  Super easy to sign up to.  They have a 30 day money back guarantee so you can try it out before committing. There are plenty of VOIP providers out there.  I recommend avoiding Magic Jack unless you want bad customer service, poor call quality and a huge amount of hassle."

To quote one 'tech' ""I'm confused""...duh!  I'm convinced all the calls went to some outsourcer in India to boot so getting through was an ordeal in itself.
If you have a very simple setup and don't care too much about security you may be very happy with this.  I can only reason that all the rave reviews by first time non-tekkie users is based on not needing alot of functionality and using device defaults.  But if you need anything more YOU need to know what you are doing because help is non-existant.  I'm sure this could be a great addition to a home network but it will take someone savvier than me to get it to work.  Good luck if you decide to go ahead with this product!"

Windows 10 Pro 64bit Toshiba laptop that already has two monitors via an Anker docking station. No gaming use, but do run CyberLink's Power Director editing and producing videos with no issues. Plays Youtube and other videos no problem.

Review:
Bought 3 different kinds and this brand/model is most reliable for my Toshiba laptop to recognize and display second screen images. In fairness, have an Anker docking station with two video ports (VGA and HDMI), so a lot going on already before I put this into the laptop's own HDMI socket.

Like:
Actually like it being two pieces with a cord inbetween - we travel a lot and easier to find in my bag than the single piece models.
It has female threads allowing you to screw the VGA connector from the monitor securely into the adapter.
HDMI connector fits well in laptop socket.

Dislike:
Sometimes not recognized - but per above multiple monitors running via different adapters already."

5703393,1.0,"These are the best cables on amazon in my opinion. They are truly 10ft long cables. They are made very heavy duty and are perfect for everyday use. You sometimes need longer usb cables. Not everyone has access to a charger thats right beside you. These are perfect for that. My husband will use these along with their 6ft cable in a dumptruck. This is perfect for his phone and the shorter to recharge his bluetooth. It would be great if technology could advance and we had batteries that lasted for the duration of our days but until then you need this cable! If you work in a shop or anywhere that you need heavy duty items these cables are perfect. They will take a beating. They also won't rub the wires  with exteneded use and short out your electronics like other plastic coated cables. They are a fantastic buy and you won't be disappointed in your purchase!

The controls work great and are easy to use, much nicer than the ones with an analog volume control.  The profile of the audio jack sticks out a bit higher than the regular, non-integrated volume controls version but not enough to be concerned about.

I have a pair of the cheaper Sony buds with no volume controls for working out and the sound is the same, so if you don't need the volume controls maybe look at those.  Don't expect them to last forever if you're working out and sweating all over them.  The two that I've had before both failed at the rubber reinforcement for the audio jack after about a year.  Doesn't really bother me to buy a new pair every year or so if they keep the price down."

  The scroll strip goes wild on a regular basis ( once every 2 weeks I guess)zooming my screen. I need to unplug the tablet and replug it.
  the click can not be adjusted correctly so it will click on hover over sometimes and on windows desk top you need to beat a hole in the tablet to get it to click. Right clicking on windows desktop icon brings up two different menu's just keep clicking till you get what you need.
 My kid's cheap 30 dollar tablet with a battery pen has much better pressure sensitivity. I believe this is normal. Its a cheap crappy pen but line control is much much better.
 last thing I can think of now but not least. WHERE DO I GET A NEW SCREEN COVER.!!?? The plastic on the tablet wore out, got scratchy after a month and I can not find a Wacom made replacement. I have not looked in the past 2 years I gave up. all the covers are costly and crappy and if you use the tablet every day you will need plastic screen every month.

I turned it on and the unit was whisper quiet so I took a breath of relief.  I then set my laptop on it and the clicking began.  The top of the cooling unit apparently began rubbing the spinning fans. I removed the laptop and applied gentle pressure to the top of the cooling unit. Again, the fans rubbed the unit and it was apparent that this unit is defective.

Very surprised and happy about that. Straps are very comfortable and have a ""shock absorber"" strap at the top. Carried some heavy loads with relative ease. Even in the humid environment, my back didn't get too sweaty. Ventilation mesh padding seems to work fairly well. Also holds my 17+"" HP laptop with plenty of room to spare, and feels very well protected with padded back and bottom. I also love the cable-reinforced carry handle.

4763768,0.0,"I bought a pair of this exact model earbuds a bit over a year ago, for the price they were pretty decent. Stayed in my ears, sounded nice; I ended up needing a new pair after the right earbud started to go on them after a year. Not the longest time for a pair of earbuds to last, but hey, they were $25 and did their job pretty well.
I decided since they were alright and was fatally too lazy to do anymore research on the cheap earbud market, I'd just go with Symphonized again. Initially I got a set of a different model, and immediately experienced issues. Within the first week they'd already fallen apart, and I promptly sent it in for refund.
So I got this model, again, and didn't fare much better. Right off the bat, the supplied nibs didn't stay in my ear, at all. Within a week of using them the little controller button jammed up, and lost it's tactile click. It still worked, but was you really had to squeeze to get anything out of it. And then, not even two months later the right earbud went out. It looks like the jack fell apart, so I can't really fix it, either.

I bought the Short Tube 80T for my nephew as a gift. Before I wrapped it up, I attached my Canon T5i to it via my own t-ring and adapter, and took a quick picture of the full Thanksgiving moon of 2015, from Vancouver, WA. It was 32 degrees outside, wind was about 5 mph, and all I had at the moment was a barely medium weight camera tripod to mount the scope on. The heavy weight alt-az tripod I ordered to go with it hadn't arrived yet. I didn't need any additional length to achieve focus. The photo is a single RAW image, processed with Canon's free photo software.

Both cards were BRUTALLY SLOW.....purchased some 16GB SanDisk class 4 cards on the same order, and they performed on par.  But the Transcend cards were agonizingly sluggish, slower than the class 4 cards.  It took forever for my PC to recognize them, formatting stalled (had to cancel it a number of times).  I have 4 different cards readers, had the same result with all of them.  One thing I noticed as well, when I removed the cards from the reader, they were HOT!  Almost too hot to touch- there was something not right about these.  Again, from reading the other reviews, I guess I got the rejects off the assembly line.

I've used all brands, sizes, and speeds of cards in the past, including other Transcend memory cards.  Never really had any issues with any of them.  For some reason, these did not perform well.  Personally, I think I just got some defective ones.  Amazon was great with the return process."

Went to work today after a month and 7 days. Left my desk to come back to find it had popped off. I put it back on.  Well, just got home and it's no where in sight.

Also, the Auvio speaker has a much crisper, clearer sound.  To truly test the sound comparison, I asked my fiance to listen to both the iHome and the Auvio speakers, and he agreed that the Auvio speaker has a much better sound, hands down.

542301,1.0,"These headphones are simply awesome and, in my opinion, give Sennheiser HD600 a run for its money (I own both). I prefer Grado's more dynamic presentation. I also happen to have SR80. While this is not a review for SR80, I must say that I am amazed at how good my SR80 are in comparison to my SR325is. No, SR80 aren't better than SR325, the latter offers clear advantages, especially apparent in side to side comparison. However, if you are on a budget, do not feel yourself left out with SR80.
SR325is has more impact, more bass, better imaging and detail. The instruments sound real and the voices could not sound more beautiful. I am particularly impressed with fading of the notes. Yet SR325 is not 3 times better than SR80, even though it costs 3 times its price. It's maybe a third better instead.
I find SR325 almost just as comfortable to wear as SR80. SR325 are a bit heavier, but nothing at all to be concerned with. I found all Grado's headphones I've tried to be very easy to wear even for extended periods of time. HD600 clamps my head harder and hurts me much more in the long run.
I've read people describing SR325 as harshly bright, but I did not find this to be true for myself. They are not fatiguing, they are just alive.

I couldn't even change to xm or ipod, had to turn the car off and restart to use the rest of the radio. I tried everything to reset it (reset the radio, deleted my phone and re-paired it, factory reset, removed power for 30 minutes). Took it to the ""factory service center"" stayed their two weeks and finally the next week, they sent it to the factory. Stayed there for six weeks and returned..... couldn't find a problem. I reinstalled it and to my suprise it worked, I know it will happen again there was a problem. Now I can be listening to xm and the radio will ""click"" and change to the ipod music. It does it everytime I get into my car. I have gotten to the point where when listening to radio, when the music stops I reach for the mode button and hit it four times to get back to the xm radio. I hate this radio......... I would just smash it with a hammer on youtube, but I have the $100 xm radio option too. IF..........

The keys are just bright enough to see during the day and don't cause any eye strain at night I am using the blue one.

The backlight needs to be turned back on every time the computer restarts which is annoying but easy to deal with.

I have been using it for about 4 months and on occasion i will hear a bit of light squeaking from the mouse wheel but otherwise no other issues.  The DPI adjustment button is easy to use and highly responsive, great for upping your mouse sensitivity in game.

I don't have the software to run benchmark tests, but anecdotally, it seems to be transferring quite fast.  And I've owned PNY products (memory sticks ) before: they are durable and reliable."

1389827,1.0,"My last pair of headphones (of similar price range) lasted me 6 years.  I loved them so much, that for the past year I've been dealing with a mostly dead right channel.  It was finally time to replace them and I had a $100 budget.  I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I do enjoy listening to crisp, clear music how it's meant to sound.  To me, these headphones do exactly that.  Their primary use is listening to music at the office, while blocking out the idle chatter.

PROS:
- Block the outside noise well and immerse me in rich sound.
- Stay in your ear extremely well.
- Very soft, light, and comfortable...even after wearing them for several hours in a day.

CONS:
- The minimum volume is ever so slightly too loud.  Even on the lowest my iPhone can go, they're a touch louder than I'd prefer in a perfectly quiet setting.
- The metal case, though nice, isn't the most convenient to put the headphones away in.  They do a great job, but to put them back away before I leave the office daily can be a little tedious.

1/1/13 Update ---
By far my favorite headphones I've owned.  The 'con' I previously listed with the volume has seemed to disappear over time.  Looks like they just needed a little break-in time, as they sound fantastic even at low levels."

I did have to call their customer service people once over a minor glitch and they were very patient and helpful. Just check your camera's compatibility before you order by going to their website.

Mostly gets the job done. There's an issue when the camera switches between ""night"" mode and regular: the shutter closes and the video output remains solid black. At first I didn't know what was causing this and had to physically unplug the camera every two days to get it to work again. Once I shut off the IR switching (and left a bright enough light on in the area) I haven't had a problem. The installed viewing software on the computer is a nightmare. The phone app works.

5055480,0.0,"It is really hard to get this this thing to work on Windows 7. I have yet to get this thing to work. It comes with no instructions on how to install it. There are several web sites claiming to that it's possible, but most of them want you to download, compile and install their software, or they provide you many links to go download a bunch of software with no way to test that your configuration works. Most instructions are Unix based. Windows 7 seems to want to think that this is some sort of infrared device. Some sketchy web sites have drivers that are available, but they didn't seem to improve the situation.

I don't know why it comes with a remote control. I would have gladly sacrificed the remote for some decent installation instructions. I just wanted to try out software defined radio, and I failed miserably.

Fortunately this was relatively cheap. It's not worth my time and postage to return this junk.

I don't have huge ears like, say, Barack Obama. They are pretty normal. But these little devils spill out with every turn of my head. I hate them.

The sound is okay: not ""WOW!"" like you expect from Bose. Maybe it's because these buggers sit outside the ear canal cradled in the outer ear. I hate them."

Everything that was said in the reviews is absolutely true about the sound quality of this unit.

Nit-picking: : I still see glare from the window behind me.

4925993,0.0,"The function of the Vivofit 2 is pretty decent. It seems to do a pretty good job of tracking steps, alerting you when you're idle too long, etc. The ""no recharging"" aspect is especially nice, given that other bands tend to get left on the charger instead of being put back on the wrist.

HOWEVER

The clasp on the band of the Vivofit 2 is pathetic. And I'm being kind. Reach into a tight space? Vivofit pops off. Brush up against something a little bit forcefully? Vivofit pops off. Put your hand in a deep pocket? Vivovit pops off. Yeah, there's a little ""locking"" button that's difficult to turn because of its shape, but if you don't remember to turn it -- you're out of luck. And the Vivofit pops off.

(NOTE TO GARMIN: Wristwatch-style buckles have been around for centuries. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, guys!)

Bottom line: Regardless of the features on the unit itself, if the Vivofit pops off and you lose it, those features are worthless. And you're out $70."

He tried the best he could to save the data but it turned out although my files were still on it somewhere, they were completely unrecoverable. Being a filmmaker and graphic designer, this was absolutely terrible - I lost all my projects and material. Though I know I should have backed up my files somewhere, it still is maddening that the hard drive failed so quickly. When I took the issue to Toshiba to get at least a refund (my hard drive was still under it's 3 year warranty) they said if I returned it, they would reimburse me with a coupon for my next Toshiba purchase. Seriously? Nothing can ever replace my files or money spent on the drive, especially not some coupon."

One bag, gadget bag is actually a re-purposed Dopp kit that holds my cords, chargers, extra eyeglasses, camera batteries, card reader, usb cords, lightning cords. The other, is my work satchel that I use to transport my laptop, tablets, and Kindle. It has a shoulder strap, but is bulky and awkward to carry.

The Dell bag easily accommodates all the above items, and cradles the laptop and tablets with soft-lined pockets that are well-padded. The construction of the bag is very good. All the zippers on my bag work well and very smoothly. I like the hand grip and the travel strap that slides onto the handle of my roller bag. The padded shoulder straps are adjustable and comfortable. The extra pockets on the side will fit some water bottles, but I will use them for additional storage. This bag qualifies for carryon on most airlines. I will use it to store all my reading material, as well as passports, boarding passes. Because of all the pockets, it takes a while to learn where everything is and how to access it easily. Small problem, for the added convenience of this nice bag. Great value!"

Basically, I've put several hundred photos on an sd card and I simply turn the frame off and on when I'm in the room.  I keep it on an end table near a sofa so there is no difficulty seeing the photos themselves. This size would be pretty small if one tried to view it from 10-12 feet.  The unit crops the photos is a reasonable way, display is strong and bright and clear even when viewed from a side angle.  I highly recommend it.  I'll probably go to the 15 inch size for my next frame so I can set it further away and still enjoy."

I should point out that I'm a tech geek and actually have a 30-inch pound 7/16"" torque wrench that I was using (that is the spec for these connectors) so I'm pretty confident that it wasn't a case of me over-torquing or using the wrong tool (like a pair of pliers, etc)."

I opened the Xbox up and reinstalled the drive several times and received the same relsults evey time.  My 4 GB internal storage showed up as well as my USB 16GB flash device. The external 250gb still was not recognized or showed up as a storage device.

I went to Gamestop the next day and purchased a used 250 GB drive for $89. My initial intent to see if it showed up as storage on the Xbox. Once I got home I noticed the 250 GB GameStop drive had  the name Microsoft on the case and appeared more genuine. I installed the GameStop drive into the Xbox and it immediately recognized the drive as additional 250 GB drive with a Microsoft logo in the storage settings.

I am returning the drive I purchased from this reseller through amazon.  Amazon return policy is excellent and I will be refunded on this fraudualt post from the reseller.

I tried charging it at home and a test call before and after I put back in her car seemed fine, but the next day it failed again. I re-read all the instructions and tried again with the same results.

The unfavorable reviews here seem to confirm our experience. I wish I had read them more carefully and returned it quickly rather than trying to make it work. It's now too late to return it.

2092733,0.0,"Kids liked this but there were some minor problems. I will list those out in a minute. The big problem however is that this stopped working in about 1.5 months. It no longer wipes or writes anything. I tried changing the battery but no luck. It is in pristine condition with no drops, scratches etc. This is pretty shoddy construction then and I am just out of return window. Kids are asking for another one, so I will be looking for some other brand now.

While it worked, this was pretty good. My younger son is in the drawing stage right now and is forever drawing stuff on any paper he can find. He liked this very much. There were a couple of problem though. First, the writing is not white as shown in the pictures. It is kind of dull flouroscent, a little difficult to see. I think brightness should have been higher or there should be some sort of brightness adjuster. Also, thoough there is a stylus provided, anything can write on this. If your fingers or palms are touching the screen while drawing, those will leave their own mark. As there is no selective wiping (you can only wipe the entire screen), any such marks become a problem.

I think this is a good toy/tool for young children. I will be looking for some other brand as a replacement. Hopefully the next one will last a little longer."
1990233,0.0,"I've worked on computers for over 20 years and I've seen a lot of products and technology. I've used Crucial products quite a bit for memory upgrades and always been satisfied. HOWEVER, their SSD products are TERRIBLE!!! The cloning software doesn't work as advertised, is sorely inflexible, and it affects the source drive. In my case it made my old HDD unbootable. In addition, the SSD lasted only one week before it completely died with no hope of recovering. This is one of the worst computer products I have ever encountered.

Follow-up:
I contacted Crucial tech support and they recommended a power reset procedure which unfortunately had no effect on getting the SSD to boot.

[...]

I have no idea why they would have such a procedure in the first place.  It seems to me that they could be having significant issues with their controllers and firmware.  I'm stuck with an unusable drive that can't be returned since it was initially loaded with all my data and no way to wipe it."

At 82% out of the box and 10 minutes later it is at 60%. That's crazy. Started freezing up, had to tap apps several times to get them to work. Had to go on the charger seems like every 45 minutes and that is giving it the benefit of doubt. Could not get the talk back to turn off. Could not find the the item that was used to turn it on. Was disappointment with this item, will be returning it and looking on my amazon account. I am returning the second tablet as well because of the malfunction of the first.

3058696,1.0,"As a long time user of Creative's X-FI platform, I was a bit ambivalent about buying into another Creative platform. I had no issues with Creative itself, but when Microsoft completely rewrote the audio stack with the debut of Windows Vista (whose audio architecture lives on in Windows 7 & 8), a big reason for having a separate audio card seemed lost, i.e. hardware accelerated audio in games. During their hey day, I was a big fan of Creative's Environmental Audio Extensions (EAX) and lamented their fading into irrelevancy. But know this, this card isn't about hardware audio acceleration, it is about the high quality DACs found on the card typically associated with high end A/V receivers -- not just for the front channels but rear channels as well. The crispness and clarity of audio that seemed lost in contemporary games when the world moved to software based audio processing has returned. The fact the card provides EAX is utterly irrelevant. First off, it seems to be a software implementation so the quality is poor, but I've accepted the fact that the world has moved on. EAX is utterly anchored in the past and this card allowed me to finally ""get over it"" (EAX). Just know this, you *WILL* enjoy a level of sound quality in games that the X-FI platform does not provide in the contemporary world of software based audio processing libraries (fmod, Wwise) with their supplanting of DirectSound3D."

Since we didn't buy it to only be able to view Blu-Ray, we're returning it.

I tried to contact Samsung first and there is no phone technical support, very little information on troubleshooting in the manual or online, and emailing technical support hasn't yielded any reply. I came here and saw others having the same problems, so we are opting to return it.

In response the review I just read about it running quietly -- I would agree, but it also runs rather hot. It makes me wonder if the quietness is because the fans aren't adequate.

I really can't recommend this to anyone. It seems as if too many of us have had it work for a short a time and quit, or had it never recognize non-Blu-Ray discs. It shouldn't claim to do both if it fails as frequently as it appears to."

The mini-CD with drivers was not needed.,  I connected the adapter to a Kangaroo Mobile PC after disconnecting WiFi and had immediate internet connection.

The connection is slower than I would like so I am going to order the USB 3.0 gigabit version and see if that speeds up the connection. The Kangaroo has both USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.  This adapter also works through a USB hub and  ethernet switch, a very positive attribute for connecting it to your network.

2413101,0.0,"Surprisingly cumbersome. The clip is about 1 and 1/2 wide, but my Kindle Keyboard top edge is only 1/2"" so it doesn't fit well.  With so little contact, it wobbles. It projects over an inch above and most of the weight is up there, so it makes it very cumbersome, and the Kindle looses the wonderful balanced feel that makes it so user-friendly. After getting tired of the thing I finally clipped it to the bottom over the keyboard and projected the light ""up"".  At least the weight is down between my hands and not as ungainly. Don't use the keyboard much anyway.
A disappointment considering the led's needed to light the screen are tiny, almost weightless and need very little power. I know all the new ones have a backlight but you'd think someone could engineer a far better light than this with little trouble. Reducing the weight and placing the tiny button cells behind the tablet to maintain balance would be a great start."

1840485,0.0,"Title says it all. If it were possible to actually apply this screen protector, I think it might work nice. Unfortunately, I'd be surprised if anybody has ever successfully applied this to their laptop screen without bubbles everywhere. I've done many screens on laptops, phones, and cameras, and I have *never* had such poor results before.

The product's instructions do not match what you actually get in the product. The wording from the packaging to the film tabs is different. They even have a sticker on the packaging that attempts to clarify  the process, but it still doesn't help.

The sticky dust protection sheet is a joke. It is designed so that you slowly peel it back as you apply the protection film. Realistically, it just gets stuck to the protection film causing all kinds of problems.

I finally got this applied and then spent over 4 hours trying to get rid of the many bubbles that were left behind. There are still many left and they won't go no matter what I do. I'm going to end up removing this junk and throwing it out. I sincerely hope that removing this thing doesn't leave any kind of lasting damage on my screen.

I will comment on the quality of this product. B+W filters are made in Germany. Germany is consistenly one of the best producers of high end glass and optics. I have been told the reason the quality of these filters is better than most is that they don't make them as separate units, but instead they build a cylinder of glass and cut each filter off of it. Consistent quality. Screw ring is hard metal, so it is very difficult to strip the threads. I have messed up the threads on cheaper brands by accident.

In my experience, buying filters falls into the category of you get what you pay for. Cheaper brands are out there, but if you want a very high quality filter, that is durable and consistent with what you want to achieve with it... you can't go wrong with B+W filters.

Be sure to choose the right size - for example, Nikon prints the size on the back of the lens cap."

The bass is awesome and the only complaint I could ever have about these is that sometimes it is hard to get the sound just right.  It may be me, I am no professional home theater person, but I get a lot of bass and background noise (standard tv show noise-voices and background noise, not static) but it is hard to hear the main actors voices.  I have noticed this in movies and tv shows.  I really do think that it is the way I have set my system up though.  The speakers work wonderfully.

I got the DVI version of the box thinking that I'd have less signal degradation if the digital-to-analog conversion was downstream of the switchbox.

Problem is that with this puppy, the monitor stayed blank no matter which computer was selected.  Spent some time with IOGear's tech support & they thought that the box was bad, suggested I send it back & I did so.  But the replacement had the same problem.

2041745,1.0,"""Apple Boxes"" serve innumerable uses in the television, motion picture and photographic industries.  If something needs to be made taller (including people!), an apple box does the job.  You can rest something on an apple box, use it as a stool, a small table.  Whatever you can think of.  Look up ""Apple Box"" in Wikipedia for a more complete explanation of apple boxes and their uses.  Apple boxes are usually made of plywood (for strength) and come in several standard sizes.  The genius of the ""Set In One"" is that all the smaller sizes are packed into the largest size, making it possible to tote a complete set in the space of one large apple box.  These apple boxes were shipped in a cardboard carton just big enough to hold the set.  The boxes are ""unfinished,"" in the sense that they aren't painted or varnished.  So, you can paint them yourself, or just use them as is.  While used widely in the visual arts, apple boxes are a ""behind the scenes"" item and are rarely seen ""on-camera,"" which is why these are probably not finished."

The problem is that the card cannot be trusted to work--with the very real risk of losing the images forever.  The low price makes this card tempting, but don't be fooled.

2468295,0.0,"I bet most positive reviews here were posted within the first 3 months of purchase.  I bought two Asus RT N66U routers. One was configured as an Access Point. I have to admit that they perform extremely well when they fully work. But they won't last long. Within a year, I did 3 RMAs to Asus service center. One was replaced twice, another one was replace once. The first  RMA was created at eighth month because the router was suddenly dead. The second RMA was created at tenth month because the replaced router wifi problems. Basically, I could access internet via wire connection to the router but could not wirelessly access internet although all devices showed wifi connection. The third RMA was created at tenth month because the 5Ghz band of other router randomly worked and 2.4Ghz band totally disappeared.

Note: Although Asus customer service is not bad but the RMA shipping is paid from your own pocket. To RMA, you need to work with them to solve the problem. If they give up, they will authorize you to RMA. The replacement will be a REFURBISHED/RECERTIFIED one, not NEW. Also, your network will be disable/cripple during RMA process which is about 10 days to 14 days.

Suggestion: As long as the router functions well in your network, ignore the new firmware. Upgrading new firmware will cause a new problem.

The mounting tabs on the power adapter and on the 4 Port Injector helped to make a very clean installation. It would have been handy if they had included mounting screws, but that was a minor inconvenience, and I understand that different installations may require different screw types and lengths.

I currently have 2 Hikvision DS-2CD2132F-I {802.3AF) cams connected and running with no issues so far. I anticipate that there is sufficient reserve power to feed the full capacity of 4 of these devices.

I noted that the AC cord shipped with the unit is a 2 wire, ungrounded type, whereas the picture on the ad and even on the sheet packaged with the unit shows it as 3-wire grounded. That doesn't bother me in the least, and I see no risk to attached hardware due to that difference. My assumption is that it isn't an intentional effort to mislead, but that they probably made a change in the power adapters that are shipped with their devices, and they didn't update their pictures."

The customer service department, shipped a new unit immediately. Received it in a couple days, installed it, and it works perfectly. I realized that sometimes devices just up and quite working, it's the nature of the beast. The biggest surprise was how quick and without any questions or hesitation the customer service department sent a new unit. They also did a follow up....you can't ask for anything better than that.

I've never used a case before but I just bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nest-Earbud-Case-Earphone-Protector-Winder-Blue/dp/B0096JQ4FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nest Earbud Case / Earphone Protector & Winder Blue</a>&nbsp;because I want to take care of these gems.

1261565,1.0,"Keeping my fingers crossed to see how long this power supply lasts.

Picked up the 850W version, needed it fast and amazon is ALWAYS great when it comes to prime shipping or prime upgrade to overnight shipping.

Plugged it in and powered up perfectly. Fan is super quiet , the modular design is great to reduce clutter.

I am just hoping this lasts a few years. I will come back and update this review if anything happens.

But as of 1 day using it, it is running perfectly.

*Update*

After about 2 weeks, the power supply continues to work flawlessly."

This things offers so much versatility as far as entertainment that i can't imagine being without one. The sound quality is better than the iPod's, the controls are very simple even with the touch pad. It has a learning curve of maybe 2 minutes but shortly after you'll feel like a pro. Watching videos on this awesome because i can access movies or TV shows while I sit in my car waiting for class to start. I have the car adapter to play music with and this 80 gig HD holds everything, I mean everything. My entire CD library is on here and it's only about 13 gigs. Movies will beging to eat up space but that all depends on the way you scale the movie size before putting it onto the Zune.

I bought this, and planning to buy another soon, so I can have two backups. Maybe I am paranoid but even great products fail eventually, and the price is do-able.

I was told by a customer service rep to order this again and I would be sent the correct item.  I ordered a 2nd time and again was sent the viewfinder with no extended bracket.  Ridiculous, do not order from Photo Smart!

Original Review:
Extremely disappointed with this seller.  First of all, the item shipped to me was not the Kamerar VF-4+, it was branded as CarrySpeed.  2nd major issue is that I ordered the extended bracket version for use with a battery grip and was sent the standard version without extended bracket.  3rd problem is that this is advertised as working with the Panasonic GH3, which it does not actually fit.  Even with the standard bracket and no battery grip, this does not fit properly on the GH3.  The fit is so tight that the viewfinder doesn't latch and light leaks in.

The only plus is that it does magnify the lcd screen significantly, making focusing a lot easier.  Unfortunately I have no way of mounting it properly on my camera."

2275889,1.0,"The SanDisc Extreme Pro 32 Gb 95Mbs can do more if you have the camera.
I have a Canon 60-D and as with the 32 GB 50Mbs and as with the memory card above I can take 50 Photos @ 5.6 a second in a burst at 18Mb in a burst before slowing down. However, this problem is because of the microprocesser in the camera itself.

The video for the Canon 60-D and the 95Mbs is another story...
I can take four hours of video nonstop at 1,920 x 1,088 pixels with a 16:9 aspect ratio -- approximating what's sometimes referred to as ""Full HD"", or 1080i/1080p, although it actually includes 8 extra rows of pixels beyond the standard 1,920 x 1,080. Both NTSC modes of 23.976 or 29.97 frames/second and PAL modes of 23.976 or 25 frames/second are available at full resolution.

I need to point out that the Canon 60-D is made from a black poly resin and aluminum unlike the T-3i which is black plastic. So the 60-D can take the heat, while the T3i cannot.

The SanDisc Extreme Pro 32Gb 50Mbs and 95Mbs can also take the heat from heavy use without stopping or fouling up the downloaded memory from the camera. The SanDisc is well made and already it has survived the scanners at the airport and the x-ray machine without a problem.

If anything, SanDisc makes one good flash memory card which can come in use with everyday and professional photography. I am impressed!"

Wow. I didn't think it would be this amazing of a difference given the actual DPI difference isn't too huge, due to the physical size increase. In reality it makes a HUGE difference. I turned down anti-aliasing on games without noticing quality loss and making the performance just as good as before on the games I tried. I'm using display port to make sure I get the best performance.

To top it off, the difference between TN and this IPS panel is night and day for colors, black levels, and viewing angles. I still have my old monitor in use next to it for comparison.

Remember those with problems are more likely to speak up, so take anecdotes in reviews about dead pixels and light bleed with a grain of salt. I had no problems with either.

Last but not least, the stand is as good as what you would expect for dropping $400. It's sturdy and has a wide range of motion.

I moved it to my Win 7 computer where it worked for a few more hours as I moved some of my files elsewhere. Then it became unreadable in Win 7 as well, and everything else I'd put on it was lost. Both operating systems still recognize it as a USB device, but can't read it.

Rotation has a lag and sometimes cannot make up its own mind, which orientation to be. There's a lag when typing with the original keyboard, and even more so with third parties. The whole Google integration is not the good compared to Apple. Very disappointing. I don't like Apple's overpricing and over-hyping, forget about comparing hardware and try the software first. Rotation, Typing and scrolling is what you do all the time, and Apple is light-years ahead."

6153968,0.0,"The sound quality is rather mediocre, tinny and without definition. That's ok, though; it's still more than good enough for kids or background music. What isn't ok, is the fact that these destroy iPods by overcharging them. Ours killed two iPods before we figured out what is happening.

If you buy one of these DO NOT leave the iPod in it for too long. There seems to be a problem with the charging circuit on these, and it may overcharge your iPod. The resulting overheating may destroy the screen, if not more, and will definitely damage the battery. As I said, we've had two screens damaged by leaving an iPod charging in one of these, so I'm fairly confident this device is to blame."

Doesn't work as a second drive. Asus z97-a board sees it, device manager sees it but windows disk management will not recognize it, sounds like a normal problem with these drive. Got another Samsung evo drive and it works just fine. Save your money and spend a few bucks more on something that works. Customer support will not respond to e-mails or answer the phone, and the phone messages don't work probably because the problem is so common they won't deal with it.

3226068,1.0,"Fits very nicely under 2007 nissan sentra front seat. Every cable is plenty long for any way you would like to hook them up. I believe you would still have enough to connect one of these under a back seat. It comes with an adapted wire if your stereo doesn't have RCA hookups for an amp built in. It does NOT come with a RCA cable. If your stereo has RCA amp outs and you would like to use them instead of splicing into your speaker wire leads you will need to buy an RCA cable SEPERATELY. I needed a 6 foot one with the woofer positioned under the driver's seat. The RCA cable you need should be the regular male to male end regardless of what head unit you own.

Also, The woofer sounds very nice. It has a nice thump to it that you can easily feel throughout the car. It's low profile design really made it easy to magically disapear and not take up any trunk space whatsoever."

The seller says there's an 'off-on' switch but I sent it back before I could find the switch & because I only was able to talk 45 minutes and it went out! Maybe I had a defective one (??). At any rate, the seller promises to send me a new one. I'll give it '4' for now because the seller is very nice and is working with me. I'm very impressed! You'd think I spent a lot of money to get the type of service they are giving. Man Frog is Awesome!

My earlier review: After pairing the instructions say to cut on press & hold 3 seconds until it turns Green. And to cut off hold for 6 seconds until it turns Red but it blinks both Green & Blue. And you have to press it hard to get it to turn on or off."

Great upgrade for AMD Athlon 2-64, Phenom II or FX series processors below the FX-6350.  Although it is an 8 core processor, the FX-6350 is slightly better on single thread processing only.  Price and value make this processor a no brainer for upgrade purchase.

This processor will run most new games without a problem.

Overclocking up to 4.0 Ghz does not cause the heat in the processor to rise dramatically, and will run at 4.0 without any issues."

Since I have had the tv just over a year, it would not be covered under warranty.  Vizio said the work would cost 301.00 to repair the t.v.  I paid almost 1600.00 when I bought my tv brand new.

It only charges at an angle and that angle will break the charge point in your phone.

1812833,0.0,"Will work for a few hours then drop the connection or will completely stop working.(Windows 7 32bit with WRT 150N router). There are a few ways to get working again. Disabling the wireless adapter. If that doesn't work use Windows Diagnostic. If that doesn't work soft reset your router and let it reassign an ip address. If that doesn't work then reinstall drivers and restart computer. If all that doesn't work you have to hard reset your rounter. That means completely wiping your router,reassigning ssid,and turning on security at the very least. Now that just with the drivers that come with the RNX-N180UBE v1086.38.1125.2010  . I alternate between the most recent driver and the one that comes with in box. The solution above will work for the drivers in the box. v1086.38.1125.2010 Now that should tell you that I rather deal with drivers from 2010 than ones from 2011. And that's because drivers issues with 2010 drivers are easier to fix. 2011 drivers will completely stop working. The only way to get up your wireless adapter working again with the most recent drivers is to hard reset your router and/or reinstall drivers. Which means headaches for the people who live with you and use the connection. Buy a different wireless adapter and don't waste your time with RNX-N180UBE."

I have confirmed that the ftdi chip is fake by reading its serial number of 0000.
Now, to be fair, the real ftdi chip apparently costs $4, so I guess one should not expect a real chip, but honestly I'd rather have paid more and saved the time and worry of a fake chip. Products with fake unreliable chips with random limitations should not be sold.

Words are clear, explosions are loud (and the bass is plenty strong), and I get a clear sense of being in a theater with the ""surround"" nature of it all. Music also sounds great, though if you're into something with very heavy bass (I'm not) you may want a stronger subwoofer.

Two of the eight drives have experienced anomolies that caused a backup to fail. When this happens we have immediately taken the drive out of service. Before we upgraded to these terabyte drives we never had one fail.

It's possible that something else has caused the anomolies, but considering the use as backup media we can't take the chance. I currently buy another brand."

I keep my alarm clock sideways on the night stand (for a few reasons) and it would be great to be able to rotate it to any degree I want. I like that it can be flipped 180 degrees around, to be looked at from either side...I just wish I could rotate it 90 degrees. Also, as someone has mentioned, the gaps between the pieces of the projected time are quite large. Not sure why they couldn't have connected them more.

Still, none of these things detract from what is ultimately a great alarm clock. Highly recommended if you need projection and/or USB charging built in to your clock. I did, and after an initial learning curve, it's working great for me so far."
3258767,1.0,"I live in a 2 story, 2000sq foot home with plaster-lath walls. I was worried the signal from this wireless router wouldn't be enough to make it up from the basement to the 2nd floor. Luckily it has worked fine and I get full signal on the 2.4Ghz and only 1 bar drop in signal strength using 5Ghz from the 2nd floor bedroom.

It's also great for diving up bandwidth between my devices. I've been able to limit those that do not require full strength all the time as well as a limit on the guest bandwidth when friends are over. Can't let them having all my signal for their phones.

The settings interface is also very easy to use when opening/closing ports for gaming. I haven't had any trouble finding what I need.

I would recommend this router. I haven't experienced any of the signal cutting out that most of the 1-star reviews are referring too, and I use this for work throughout the day."

2404018,0.0,"Extremely disappointing especially after reading some of these reviews.  Purchased two of this product.  The USB Cable was not included in either box although it was listed as an included item (first red flag).  One package looked like it was repacked and the product may have been used or returned.  The longest loop recording interval was three minutes and the manual referred to up to 15 minutes.  You would think that these manufacturers would spend a little money in putting together a more elaborate users manual.  Extremely stupid marketing to include a tiny user manual that you need a magnifying glass to read and which is entirely unhelpful when read.  You would think that it would be in their best interest to provide a painstakingly detailed user manual and, better yet, a detailed video explanation of their product on YouTube. There happens to be a YouTube video for the Carcam K2000 Car DVR, but even that one lacks the careful detail in explaining to a newbie buyer the significance of all of the features and details of setting all of the options."

Other younger and wiser reviewers will tell you all about the technical aspects far better than I can, but I can at least assure you that the Grace Digital does have universal appeal.  With music, news, and sports from around the globe, 17,000+ radio stations, and 20,000+ on demand radio programs, I have a lot to like.

But it's the Pandora radio individual stations that put the icing on the cake for me.  After registering at the Grace website, I was able to set up my own stations.  I entered the name of my favorite artist, and now have my own easy-to-return-to station playing similar music.

We bought this player for great visuals, and that's why I'm giving it five stars, but we were shocked to learn that there's no resume play on blu-ray discs.

You can view the chapter number by hitting the Track Forward button, but then you're in a different place. You can display how much time has elapsed and then fast forward, but the fast forward is kludgy and you still have to sit through all the legal warnings plus fast forward through the previews.

The problem is they do not work for long. I have had to get several replacements as the begin to drop in and out after a few months. The only resolution I have found is to replace the units. I have used both cat5 and cat6 cable at multiple locations  all with the same results. Great for a few months then they begin to fail. I am a network engineer and have triple checked the rj45 connectors and cable. When a problem of dropping an no display occurs replacement of the transmitter and remote fixes every time. Putting the old one back and the problem is there. I just had the final failure at my church. I am replacing all with another brand/product.
3799825,0.0,"This adapter loses too much light so it performs quite poorly at night or indoors. I use the adapter with the Minolta 100-300 mm APO on the A6000. Even under bright day light, in order to get anything decent indoors, ISO needs to be at 3200. As compared to the native emount 55-210, under the same focal length and aperture, the adapter seems to cause a loss of 2 stops.

In addition, the AF is not very accurate and it is just miss more than hit. No matter what amount of micro AF that I tried to adjust, focus always come out to be somewhat blurry. I used the focus magnification to check whether the adapter has obtained sharp focus and 100% of the time, it is off and I need to go to  manual focus.

I am not sure if I get a bad variation of the adapter but for my sample, it is rather useless. I was hoping to go to full frame. Since most of the full frame emount lens are quite expensive, I thought the LA-EA4 plus some A mount lens can be a good option. However, sadly, this does not appear to be the case if my sample represents typical performance."

Unfortunately, as someone who listens to music for hours at a time, these cans are the heaviest I've ever experienced.

But I'm writing this in January 2013.  After I had returned two sets of Harry Potter Blu-ray disks to Amazon complaining that they must be defective.  Since my Samsung played my ""Blade Runner"" Blu-ray just fine, it *MUST* have been those disks, right?  Well, maybe not.  I also rented several Blu-rays from Red Box - and none of them seemed to play.  I either get pixelation, freezes, and audio issues several minutes in - or the disk doesn't play at all and I get the message ""This disc can not be played"".  Yes - I did update to the latest firmware and tried again.

2764654,1.0,"I bought this cover because it has the hand strap, it can prop my Kindle up, and I also wanted the auto wake/sleep feature. I've used this for about 7 months now. I read and/or play games, check email etc. everyday and the cover still looks fabulous. The hand strap is comfortable and has held up well.

The only thing I've noticed is that the strap that holds the two sides of the cover together when it is open has become very stretched. It still works though.

Like some people have mentioned when the Kindle is in it's upright position in the cover it is actually upside down. It has to go in that way so it is in the right position to prop in the case when used sideways to watch movies or skype etc. If you have any games that you can only play upright just make sure you lock your screen by swiping down your menu bar at the top and on the left tapping the lock. Now open your game and it will open the way you want it to in the cover. Takes a little getting used to, but wasn't a big deal for me.

I've used it with both my LG VX8300 phone and several different cameras with no hiccups at all.

Well, one small hiccup. . .  It comes with an adapter that bumps it up to the size of a standard SD card.  The description claims ""universal"" compatibility when using the adapter, but my three-year-old Viking IntelliFlash reader didn't know what to do with it.  I called their tech support and they confirmed that not all readers will recognize the adapter even though it fits just fine.  So you may be in for an upgrade of your card reader as well.

I would gladly have sent it back for a working stand and given a positive review, however when I contacted customer service they want me to buy a box to send it back in, pay for shipping, and then after they receive the faulty stand they will send me a new one. I emailed and asked if they could send me a new one, then I could use the box to send the broken stand back. They refused. I will NEVER buy from Adorama again.

May 31 I decide to plug it in and assess the noise of the fan that people have commented on as being loud and to try to charge a camera battery.  This unit appeared to be dead.  The cord fits snugly into the converter unit and I plugged the two prong plug end into the American adapter plug, then plugged the converter into a house wall socket.  No lights, no fan, so I attached the camera battery charger but no electricity was being sent to the battery.  I fiddled with the connections by reversing the position of the adapter plug onto the cord of the converter, but nothing produced electricity being fed to the battery charger plugged into the converter, so I have to give my unit a low rating.  The sad thing is that I waited longer than 30 days to test the unit so I can no longer return it and am stuck with an expensive, nicely designed, seemingly well-made piece of junk. Learn from my mistake and test your converter while you still have time to return it if it is defective."

Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. I ordered one unit and the moment I turned it on, I got the flashing blue LED of death. I was distraught. I figured it was just a fluke, so I got a replacement from Amazon.

Lo and behold, the second one had the same exact flashing blue LED problem with the same LEDs failing to light up. I was thinking of going for 3rd time a charm, but I didn't want to risk it because if 2 units in a row exhibit the same blue LED of death, I figured something was wrong.

I'm not sure why this NAS was DOA on arrival twice. That doesn't exactly inspire confidence in a system that's one grand.

The only thing I might be able to blame is the altitude. I live on a mountain 7000 feet above sea level, and Synology NAS' are only rated to operate up to 6500 feet above sea level. If this is the case, that's a little ridiculous."

In addition, the forums are filled with people who have tried everything and failed. I believe this issue may be related to the BIOS version since other people have been successful with older BIOS versions.

DO NOT DOWNGRADE YOUR BIOS. After trying everything I downgraded my BIOS and now I keep getting an error 62. This motherboard is a pain  you will not get 5, 6, or even 7 GPUs to run on this machine any time soon.

Basically the ability to be folded up and put into a smaller area is one of the reasons I purchased them. That being said, these are my 4th pair of Sennheisers. (202, HD 280, tried the 595 HD) The sound is fairly crisp in general and in my opinion is somewhat heavy on the bass. Because of the mids are toned down and the highs considerably more difficult to hear on a song with a lot of bass. The mid-range is the only part it is really lacking in. And when you have the volume high on rock music, some crackling can begin to be heard. For a set this small though, you wouldn't believe the amplitude and clarity of sound these can produce. They aren't in-ear phones, but the minimal size difference is worth it for the increased quality.

There is no way to turn this Saved Places display at all based on Garmin customer support.  I have to return this unit and avoid buying Garmin with this design flaw.  Frankly this is a simple software issue that Garmin programmers can easily resolve (by addiing an option to enable/disable displaying Saved Places icons).  Yet, Customer Support chooses the easy way out by saying there is no such option.

I have owned about 10 Garmin GPS units so far, and none of the previous ones I have show this problem.

Eventually it got to the point where my Asus would get stuck on the OS selection screen (I have a Linux partition) and the Dell would freeze after once I logged in. Once the mouse usb dongle was removed they again worked fine.  Ive never had this happen and Ive owned devices a lot cheaper than the $30 + I paid for this.

After reading the issue was resolved, I stupidly assumed that Amazon (not a reseller) would only be stocking the new units.  Wrong.  Everything was fine loading the stick, but when I tried to use it on my vacation today it was DOA.  Now I am sitting on vacation with my kids and all of their videos are inaccessible. I'd gladly pay for VOD fees but there is no Internet connection here besides my phone.  Thanks Transcend!  The eight hour flight was AWESOME thanks to your incompetence and the next ten days should be even better.  Maybe you can send me that RMA number via smoke signal.

But at least I didn't lose anything important like family photos.  A little perspective.  But a reason not to trust this company with this or any other memory related product.

Now if you go to the Monoprice website they list the system at $251.20 with no mention of its list value of $647.62. I detect some price bumping to make us believe we are getting some smoking hot 64% off deal when that's not the case.

Another feature I really like is that it comes with a cable tie. You save the hassle of finding a cable tie. It's easy to just roll up and tie and go. I have used this on, iphone 5s, iphone 6 and 6s and charged every phone without a problem. I've also used it on an ipad air 2 and no problems there either.

I really like RavPower products. I've been using their products for a long time and I can tell you that they have an amazing customer service department.

You hardly find that on new products since companies are so afraid of dealing with customers having to contact them.

No passwords or user accounted needed.  I just drag and drop my files.  It's pretty fast at 100 MB, so I am happy with the speed.  I expect it to be faster when I upgrade to a gig Ethernet switch.

I have 4 systems (3 xp and 1 vista) on my home network and all of them can map a drive to it does exactly what I expect it to do...be a network drive to store pictures, software, files, etc.

Most of the time it doesn't connect for almost a minute. Sometimes it just drops off line and locks up. Then again, it doesn't cost much either. So, if you want something that works part time and you don't want to pay much for it, this is the mouse for you.

I finally gave up and pulled the little mini-Logitech mouse from my old moribund Windows laptop. This is the cheaper of the small Logitech mice, but it still has that nifty and very small USB transmitter than you can leave in all the time. It works with Linux, Apple, Windows etc etc and it is much smoother to boot. Connects first time, every time and in a heartbeat. It costs more, but then so does a Lexus. It just works and keeps on working.

But a call to the device's extremely helpful and knowledgeable customer service department solved my problem (it was operator error).

What really, REALLY impressed me was what happened when I spilled a large cup of hot coffee with sugar, creamer, etc. all over this HD. After frantically doing what I could to save my laptop, by the time I noticed the HD was completely soaked it was probably five minutes later.

Switched cables, switched all points of connection to no avail.
On the other computers with Windows 8.1 it changed the graphics settings but did at least complete but on all the computers it effected the Resolution settings where I had to change them from what they were to what would work with this device, as mentioned one computer would not do anything despite me starting it in ''Safe Mode'' and being able to try every resolution setting offered in the computer.
I put back the Trend net unit and all is fine on all computers so it is being returned and a Trend Net unit for 4 computers will be ordered in place of this thing."

It is large.  If you're someone who's traveling a lot and prefers a mouse over the laptop's trackpad, it might be wise to consider something smaller in size.  However, if you don't mind carrying it then it's a great mouse to use.

The battery can be changed, but I've never done it.  There is a compartment on the underside of the mouse that stores the rechargeable battery, which could be changed, but again I haven't tried.

There's no place to leave the usb but it's small enough that you can leave it attached to your laptop.  If usb ports are a commodity like on many macbook pros then the compartment where the battery goes can store the usb.  It's not designed to do that but I've done it a few times and it's convenient."

The product information does not provide this information. The 2003 modem works with the old PC and this cable modem telephone so how is this not possible in 2013?

To understand just how durable the previous version was; I have it attached to my key chain which I use everyday.  The metal cover completely protects the four USB connector contacts and flips relatively easily open, with the finger nail grove.  The earlier model stays closed all the time and had a tight fit to keep it from inadvertantly opening.

Looking at the never and ""better"" design DataTraveler SE9, I can see that it's inferior in a number of ways.  I potentially exposes the connectors at all times, it also doesn't properly hold the memory chip to the case, and lastly it doesn't allow for easily inserting the USB into any space imaginable.  It ovious to me that to produce the DT108, which has a protective cover and hinge with a nice small key chain loop, must have been a few penies more to manufacture.

So, I called Kingston customer service and they confirmed that once the discontinue a product line it never come back, but based on the number of similiar failure complains, perhaps the bean counters didn't want to design a product that would last as long as the DT108, and want people to be forced to upgrade the newer product after a few months, due to an inferior ""new"" design."

First off, the processor is so slow, it is not even funny. 6 million PoIs?  It takes about 3 minutes to find a PoI and by that time you are way past it.
Second, battery life is non-existent. If you leave it in the glove compartment for 2 days, the unit dies and does a reset.
Third, if you by any chance interrupt power when it is calculating routes (say turning the key from ACC to ON or to Start), then the unit freezes and you have to find a sharp object to do a hard reset.
Finally, it takes a good 2-3 minutes to lock on satellites and get the 3D fix if you haven't used the unit for a couple of days.  Garmin even has a predictive algorithm to predict where to find satellites and acquires them faster.

I couldn't connect with the Atheros wireless card, which has drivers in the Linux kernel. It also wouldn't connect with Ethernet(!). Instead of saving settings in BIOS, and immediately doing a warm reboot it turned the machine off. Once at the desktop, it worked for a few minutes and then froze up completely. Hitting the Reset button caused it to shut down, then do a cold restart, a behavior I have seen with no other board. Perhaps I didn't read the manual well enough on the last point.

I have submitted for a return and replacement. I'm hoping I just got a lemon. After 2 Asus M5A99FX were unsatisfactory and just quit for no reason at all. I went with Gigabyte. The Asus had a few more features, and a pretty sweet interface, but with it, I got two lemons in a row."

So I have always used regular earbuds with silicone tips but because I run a lot, they can fall out.  My friends kept saying I should ""invest"" in beats by Dre.

374845,0.0,"I have 400 DVD's burned with JACKET_P folders on each and every one. Every one works with my Sony DVP-985 player. None of them work with the Sony DVP-995 Player.

I also have the same 400 DVD disks burned with title/artist information on the disk. In my DVP-985, the title and artist is both picked up and displayed on the player.

On the DVP-995 player THE TITLE IS THE ONLY THING THE ""NEW"" DISK EXPLORER CAN PICK UP. ALL MY ARTIST INFORMATION IS MISSING.

Since both the JACKET_P folder and the Artist information work perfectly on all 400 disks in the Sony dvp-985 player I have used for 2 years, I conclude that when Sony re-designed the disk explorer in the DVP-995 player, THEY BROKE THE STANDARD RULES FOR READING AND DISPLAYING INFORMATION WHICH THEY THEMSELVES CREATED WHEN THEY CREATED THE DVP-985 PLAYER.

BEWARE! If you have a dvp-985 and hope to upgrade as I did,  all your disk labeling work has been wasted.  You must go through the exercise all over again and learn the new rules for JACKET_P and Disk title/artist information, then burn new disks using the new rules.

I watched an hour long video of him and his buddies adventure through the forest and was especially impressed with it's sound recording (I was able to follow conversations between my camera equipped son and those in his vicinity.) The sound is recorded in pcm-wav format which does bulk-up the file size but I know there are legit reasons for doing it that way.

I was able to take the downloaded video directly into VirtualDub for editing and extracted an awesome wreck sequence that he wanted to share with the guys. Search for video: [ BlogDogIt ""Any Landing..."" ]  for this camera in action. Please note this was his first time out with the camera and he has gotten better at aiming it for an even more enjoyable video.

Sure it will trigger a flash, but you cant actually use it because the screen will be black when it comes time to focus because the camera won't recognize the flash and cant compensate for it.

1653116,0.0,"I purchased this camera as replacement for my Olympus 770SW-- which by the way, performed very well.  The Stylus Tough 8010, however, produces inferior photos.  Even when using the flash indoors, the resulting photos tend to come out underexposed-- even after using the exposure compensation.  I took five photos on a tripod with the same composition with both fill flash on and with auto flash on.  In all instances the flash fired but the exposure for the photos varied.  There obivously is a pre-flash built in the camera and this may be causing the camera to misread/miscalculate exposure. Also, indoors under incandescent lighting, if you use auto White Balance any white has a blue tint.  If you use the incandescent setting for WB, EVERYTHING COMES OUT AN UNNATURAL BLUE.

It seems that the trend for camera companies is to add impressive features, gimmicks, etc. aimed at the novice photographer rather than focusing on actual image quality."

First off, as other reviews have noted it's incredibly noisy.  I just wanted an outlet / USB cluster for an obscure corner of my living room, and this device is easily the loudest thing in the room, beating out a game console and a PC.  I've never seen a power strip even need a fan, much less have one anywhere near the noise level of this.

3941582,1.0,"We successfully replaced our Comcast cable modem with this device , saving us money on monthly modem fees, and replaced up our old wifi router all at the same time. As a wifi router, it performs comparably to our old, offering 4 ethernet cable connections plus the wifi. We're able to stream Netflix via the wifi without issue. Our printer connects to it wirelessly. The 450 in the name is because it supports speeds of up to 450 Mbps at 2.4 GigaHertz.

Setup was straight forward and easy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, including basic information on  the most common cable internet service providers. The most work was calling Comcast to provide the new modem model, serial and CM MAC information, so that they could activate it as a part of their network. They had no problem with it, just took a while on the phone (June 2014).

Configuration of the router is standard stuff from a ethernet cable connected PC. The manual says the PC must be DHCP enabled.  I know that's not a problem for Windows 7 or 8, so it wasn't an issue for us. I accepted the defaults, except for giving the router my own name, password and encryption key. By the way, changing the password was non-obvious as there are a lot of menu options. Just look for Set Password about half-way down.

I'm quite happy with the speeds so far, running multiple devices at once, and with saving money from Comcast, always a plus."

My only concern when deciding to buy this was the audio recording. My tests reveal that for a novice like myself, the audio is more than adequate. Slightly muffled with the waterproof case, but what do you expect when recording in or under water?

Even for experts, this would make one hell-uv-a backup recorder for you, especially due to it's very small size - exactly credit card size L x W and about 1/2 inch thick, when outside the waterproof case.

Tons of mounting brackets both for the main camera and also for the waterproof case. The one thing that I really wanted was the pole mount bracket, which is sold separately... o well.

The time-lapse feature is probably my favorite, I've always wanted to do this with a camera. Next is the included remote, a must if you want good selfies!!!

I have not tested battery life, but I also purchased a Suntactics sCharger-14 Solar charger, and a Com-pad Power-Bank 15000 to go with this and my other cameras/phones.

If your current Panasonic cordless phone has a PP104 (with a #29 displayed in a black box on the battery) NiMH battery pack then this is the unit you need.  I received two of these batteries from Amazon.com in just two days.  I had them installed in my cordless phones in just a couple of minutes.  I left the phones on the charger overnight and my phones now work flawlessly.  I am a little dissapointed that the batteries which came with the Panasonic phones only lasted about a year, but so far these new battery packs have brought new life back to my phones.  The cost is fair and the quality seems just as good if not better than the original factory batteries.  I know there are after market batteries that are compatible with my phones, and could be used in place of these PP104A units, but I believe in sticking with original equipment.

The battery for this camera is a new one, and is not yet available on Amazon....so better not buy the bundle until you check out what battery they are putting in it!

1985111,1.0,"First of all, the sound bar is great.  But i want to address a silly concern i read in another review complaining that the sound bar doesn't have optical audio input.  That's like complaining that you bought a carburetor for your fuel injected motor. Sound silly right?
Okay, assuming you bought a correct product for your setup, i'll say this.
The audio syncing is perfect.  I used a sony setup before that sometimes had a small lag, but the vizio works great for that.  The sound improvement was instantly notable, and turning it up full volume was great.  clear sounding.
So here's the deal, its like a $100 unit.  Don't expect $1000 worth of quality.  But if you have a flat tv that has poor speakers or you've worn out the speakers over the years, then this will be a great solution for you."
1906603,1.0,"I spent a lot of time looking at my options for a wide angle lens for my Canon.  I read many reviews of this lens, and the Canon 16-35 2.8.  In all, I probably spent 4 months researching.  The Canon 16-35 is a stellar lens, that can't be argued.  However, this Sigma lens was very well reviewed, as well.

It finally came down to these factors for me:

1)  Half the focal length of the 16-35 is already covered by my 24-70 2.8.  What I wanted was a lens that I could get significantly wider width, and the Sigma deliver that.

2)  Price.  Lets face it, this lens is half the price of the 16-35.

3)  Purpose.  As I said, I've already got the 24-70, and wanted a lens that could give me a wider field of view for landscape photography.  I also wanted to stay away from fisheye lenses because of the distortion.  The Sigma is the only rectilinear lens that delivers this range of view.

So, now that I have the lens, what do I think of it?

I love it.  It delivers great image quality, and a field of view that's equally impressive.

I've really had some fun with it shooting night shots with 15 and 30 second exposure times.

For landscape shots, the Sigma delivers crisp images, with no chromatic aberrations.  I've read some comments that people have had focusing problems with this lens, but I have no complaints.

This lens lives up to everything I hoped and expected it would be.  I'd buy it again if I had the choice to make over."
59265,0.0,"I bought two-one for my bedroom and one for my classroom. I like the zoom features on the Toshiba as well as the ability to speed up, choose whether you want to see the DVD in widescreen or regular format (if the DVD supports it), and the remote control is very thorough. You can also set what type of sound you want (and I don't mean languages) as well as the picture mode (animation, movie, etc...). The one complaint I have is I can't save a spot in the memory unless the movie is not playing.
I'm editing my rating.  One of the two has quit working.  The sound ceased to work on the one at work.  For no reason.  Right now it's a very big paperweight.  Avoid Toshiba.  The other one seems OK but for it to die in the amount of time it did, that makes me one very unhappy camper.  Go for another brand and save your money.
Yet another edit...the second one has bit the dust too.  And, ironically, the sound was the primary problem.  I like Toshiba but I had two die and a friend had one die.  Maybe they just aren't meant to make good DVD players."

I have tries rubber tipped stylus pens but they lack the sure footed feel you get with this fine point device. Another cool feature is the clear disk surrounding the fine point. It lets me see the letters, numbers or punctuation change color as I punch each ""key"". Very cool and really smart.

As a pen geek, I like the high tech construction. It feels like a well made product; all metal, with a brushed aluminum finish. The 'clip' to hold it in your shirt pocket is a sexy looking notch in the barrel. But it's a little less effective in practice. Better designed is the cap. It screws on and off. But the smart feature is that when it screws off, there is a threaded end so you can store it there, saving it from the land of the lost.

The tip has a shock absorbing point, preventing screen damage. Also smart!

You can place the flat tip on the screen and glide it to scroll. That works really well and is my favorite feature.

High tech design. Good quality. Fits in your pocket. Affordable.

2258426,0.0,"The outside of this box says ""PC + Mac"".  However, only after purchasing it, trying to install and so on, do you discover that the Canvio Connect won't ""mount"" because it cannot draw enough power from MacBook Air - and I discovered this only after an hour of on-line searching for solutions (see article at [...]  - 2011 and still not fixed!).  In fine print on the box, ""For the few computers that limit bus power, a special USB power cable is required"" with a website; but no mention of the name of the cord on the website, you have to guess and hunt.  Apparently Toshiba has finally agreed the Canvio needs extra power but you have to purchase their Y-cord.  True, it's under $10, but the reviews of the cord are also terrible - apparently it breaks easily and stops working.  I'm stuck with a drive that won't work, can't be returned, and MAY store my precious back-up materials if I buy another cord, wait for delivery, and hope it keeps working.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS if you use or might use a MacBook Air.  Chalk this up to being stupid and desperate when my other back up stopped working.

3927655,1.0,"It snaps shut neatly and easily.  It protects reasonably well--no case alone will be perfect.  It stands up very well in a variety of positions, upright for typing, angled for movies.  The cover folds all the way back to use the tablet one-handed.  The color is just as shown in the photo, which is what I was hoping for.  There are four oversized business card slots.  For depth they are about right for a business card so that only a tiny bit peeks our.  For width, because they run the entire length of the case split in half, they are very large.  I found this helpful because my work ID is a bit larger than a business card, and I wanted to tuck it in there.

There are a few small items I dislike, but they are minor.

The cover does shift a tiny bit, which can cause some bits of the bottom or top to be exposed, but not enough to endanger the screen.  I have the habit of putting the device in case and the case in a sleeve, for extra protection.  I have rather destructive cats, so I get a bit paranoid about these things.

The little snap strap can swing in front of the device blocking the screen, and it can get a bit annoying sometimes.  I've gotten it to stay out of my way most of the time.  You kind of have to trap it between the device and the cover."

If there are other wireless shutter releases in the area, you'll have to switch the dip switches on both units to another setting (same on each).  With the antenna fully retracted, I could get it to work fine from a distance of 30 feet.

Turn on the receiver when you want to use it by pressing the gray button.  Press it again to power down the receiver.

The transmitter comes on when you press the button.

Press the transmitter button down half way (as you would the shutter release on the camera) and it will focus and set the exposure -- as expected.

Press it all the way down and it will take the shot.

For night shots, hold the transmitter button for at least 3 seconds and the camera will go into ""bulb"" mode with the shutter staying open.  Press it again to close the shutter.

I did not experience the transmitter shutting down after a minute.  Maybe they fixed that problem.

It is not to bad on my MSI notebook which has notoriously weak sound. Much worse on my ASUS MB gaming system. Completely uncontrollable on my new HP DV7-7000 which has particularly strong sound for a notebook. I put up with it for a while but it is going back today. It would be a good device if it attenuated the sound level AFTER it leaves the PC and not control the sound level INSIDE the PC.

5654228,1.0,"I love this thing. I cannot believe how long the battery lasts. Sounds great for a speaker under $40. The only bad things I could say are:

1) Lacks low end (bass), but that's the tradeoff for long lasting battery. Placing it in a corner helps a little.
2) Flickering blue LED is annoying when using audio cable. I wish it had an accompanying app (or button) to disable blue LED, and to display which device is currently paired via Bluetooth, as multiple users pair with it at different times and may not be aware they are paired. It seems to remember the last device, instead of listening for the closest. I covered it with black electrical tape.

The lateral movement along with the side swivel of the articulating arm is very convenient for him to watch from his crib while going to sleep. You can also tilt up or down for even more flexibility in viewing angle all while still mounting to one stud in the wall. I plan to purchase this mount for our room and the 37"".

Unfortunately, the scroll wheel was dodgy at best when I first got it, and in the couple of months I've had it, the scrolling has all but stopped working. Needless to say, this makes the mouse nearly unusable for many applications, including almost everything I need to do. It was about ten dollars less than the logitech mouse I use at home, which is why I picked it up for my office, but I regret my attempt to be frugal, as now it is simply garbage I spent $17 on."

For around 30 bucks, I was able to give new life to a large set of tools that have just been sitting around the shop collecting dust because I could not get their batteries to take a charge. These replacements fit all those tools. I haven't checked out battery life yet but just seeing them working again at all was a joy for me. One battery did get extremely hot on the charger. I didn't take it off right away once it was fully charged and that could be why. It worked fine but took a long time to cool down which was a bit concerning. I almost needed an oven mitt to hold it. The other other I removed from the charger right away and though it was warm, it did not have the intense heat the other did. I will continue testing and will update my review if further information comes to light."

1022124,1.0,"This card is working flawlessly in my old inexpensive 'Toshiba Camileo B10 Full HD Movie Camera'. I
have filmed multiple clips at the high resolution of 1080p and have had no problems. There have
been no dropped frames or choppy playback. The Class 6 card appears to be working just fine with
this old movie camera.

I purchased this card in February 2012 knowing I needed a Class 6 or Class 10 card to keep up with
the continuous flow of the  movie camera and so opted for the, then, less expensive card. Even with
film cameras, if one is going to take bursts of continuous shots or shoot in RAW format, say at a
sporting event, you will want to start with a 'Class 4' with a minimum of '30MB/s' Read/Write speed.

Do NOT try to use a 'Class 2' card for a movie at all. A Class 4 card might work at a lower definition
from what I understand, but I have not tried it. Often you will find recommendations for which memory
card to use in the camera's manual. You could also go to the manufacturers' web site for guidelines
of which cards to use as well. Usually there is very good information right on Amazon's product page
from the manufacturer that can help you decide which card to purchase.

This is another fine SanDisk card that I purchased from Amazon over 18 months ago and received good
service from the card and from the vendor. I give it 5 stars due to its fine performance and reasonable
price, as well as, quick shipping and minimal packaging."

I could pair the tablet with this unit, but everytime I switched to another app or the Xoom went into power-save mode, the pairing was broken and I had to actually press the unit to re-pair.  This unit should automatically pair with the tablet whenever it is around.  Shouldn't have to jump through hoops.

Once you manage to get the device to re-pair, then it becomes obvious how poor the software is.  I haven't spent a lot of time trying to figure out the advanced programming for my devices.  Because, in the end, if I set the tablet down for 10 minutes, the software will be useless when I try to use the program again until I re-pair the remote with my tablet.

I also like how they fold up nicely for easy storage. The audio jack fits all of our devices, which include our iPhones, leap pads, and iPad.
The sound is very good too, its not muffled and is clear. There is no static either. We haven't had any problems with the cord and jack. Usually after time that starts going out on cheaper head phones. So far this is working great and my daughter uses it all the time. Its nice to take in the car with us, when we go on long road trips!

55526,0.0,"I previously reviewed this modem, giving it 5 stars because it was so easy to set up and initially it worked fine.  Well, I spoke too soon.  About 3 weeks after installing it started losing cable connectivity, exhibiting a classic ""warmup"" problem:  it would work fine for about 20 minutes after powerup, but then quit.
Just to be sure, I had AT&T come out to check the cable.  The technician thought perhaps it was an interference problem (I live near some broadcast towers), tried cleaning up the connections, etc., but to no avail.  Eventually he replaced the Best Data modem with a Surfboard 4100 (which he says works in the harshest environments).  The Surfboard has been working fine ever since.
Luckily my Best Data modem died within 30 days so Amazon very graciously refunded my money (what a great company!).  It's a good thing, too, because, without paying $7 (=3 weeks of modem lease from AT&T), I could not get any support at all from Best Data (nobody answers phone or email).
I'm going to go back to leasing from AT&T.  A Surfboard costs about [item price], which is too long to amortize, and it's just not worth the hassle if something goes wrong."

The viewfinder and LCD screen are smaller than they could be (A57 is 3 inches and A58 is only 2.7 inches).  Speed and performance have taken a hit with the increased resolution as well. However, it still compares well feature-wise with its rivals but with a lower price. It can't quite match the quality and performance of the Pentax K-30.

Then, I started getting these episodes where, all of a sudden, the screen would go blank (not really blank, but more like non-moving snow, if that makes any sense). I could still hear the show but could see nothing. Since my TV was brand new, I needed to find out which component was the culprit , and fast. And the easiest one (and first) to be tested was the Monoprice cable. I decided to use a 4 year old (but still brand new, unopened)  HDMI cable I had laying around and the problem went away! I then went back to Amazon and bought a different cable that was twice the cost ($14) but had very good reviews, and when it came I plugged it in. Problem still gone but now I'm also enjoying 4K HDR video to boot.
In conclusion, I guess it's true you get what you pay for. This cable is cheap because it's cheaply made, and if it won't conduct a 4K signal reliably, it is worthless to me. Kind of disappointed in Monoprice over this one."

No damage, and it still works OK."

My right earpiece stopped working properly after a few days and the volume output is now significantly lower than that of the left earpiece. I was not rough with theses headphones and I took care of them, plus I only had them for a few days! Do not buy these headphones. Buy from a more reliable brand or at least from somewhere that has better durability ratings!"

I could usually get it to work by unplugging it and replugging it several times, which apparently would reset the device. LaCrosse Technical Support said that the problem was likely a bad AC adapter. Unfortunately, they don't sell replacement adapters for this model, even though it was still being sold by the company, so my charger is effectively bricked. Companies that don't support customers like this don't warrant my business or yours, especially since this device -- which is supposed to help consumers be more environmentally friendly by the use of rechargeable batteries -- is doing little more than contributing poor-quality devices to your local ecycling facility.

These headphones look just great, perfect small size, and with really good sound once the tips are changed to the biggest provided (the ones that came installed made them sound flat without enough bass). The PC software to install songs in the built-in memory is quite simple and intuitive, and it does the job. Once the songs where transferred and both headphones were fully charged it started playing right away once placed in the ears. It is really an indescribable experience to wear such a weightless headphones with good and loud sound. I understand, based on other reviews, that the battery may not last more than a couple of hours when playing out of the built-in memory, but for working out that is just plenty, and the truly wireless feeling is priceless.

529327,0.0,"This 4 port USB printer switch is a manual switch and just not reliable, in my opinion. (many years experience as technician)
Most print jobs require the switch button(s) to be exercised several times before the computer(s) will recognize the printer through the switch. When the switch is making good contact the print job will commence but often times the print job will stop because the printer switch fails to continue to make good connection(s) between computer/printer. Re-exercising the switch button(s) and starting the print job over will usually complete the print job, if short. Long print jobs have required by-passing the switch entirely. I realize this is not an expensive switch but it is also NOT a reliable switch. Bottom line: I would not recommend this particular ABCD switch nor would I purchase it again.
The company selling this switch has been professional and has offered a replacement (return date expired from Amazon) but with the low price of this switch it is just not worth investing more money for return shipping/handling/transportation(my gasoline) to have it replaced with same switch again.
I remember when a simple manual switch was reliable and still inexpensive.
I would not recommend this switch as a computer to printer switching device.

First off, both ends are white.  Mine does output stereo so you have to guess which post is actually the correct channel (vs L/White R/Red).  However, the worst part is the actual 3.5mm jack.  Any movement what-so-ever cause terrible feedback and the cable to fall out of the jack.  So this now went from an incorrect purchase to a worthless item.

6186676,0.0,"I did not buy this flash from Amazon, but from a local camera store (and for a lot more than the current price,) and it has spent more time in the box than on a camera.  Several reasons.  First, a previous review mentioned it wouldn't work with a 70D.  I have two 60Ds, and before that a Rebel T2i and a 20D.  The main reason it's been in the box is that it has to be held in just such a way, while in the hotshoe, or it will not flash at all about 70% of the time.  The second reason is that the color is off, compared to the two Nikon SB-24s I also use.  The third reason is that it doesn't work outside of the hotshoe except in ""wireless"" mode.  But it's not radio wireless, it's optical wireless.  I have now put a gel on it, and will use it sometimes with my new Zoom Li-on flash that also has ""wireless mode,"" but also can be triggered using my Pocket Wizards (which the 7500EDF cannot.) It also can't compete with the SB-24 when on the other 60D, since it won't work all the time, and has color temperature issues when it does.  (Posted by Peter Wine, photographer)"

Takes a little bit to do but nice feature to have when you want to use it to send pictures to another device or computer.  I like the shake mode and is part of why I got this new camera.  I am so used to taking pictures with my phone that does take the shake under control.  I noticed my older camera did not have this feature and alot of my photos were blurry due to my moving the camera too quickly. I needed to get a camera that took the shaking under control since I am so used to my phone.  It works great and I take beautiful pictures again.  No blurry pics just like my phone pics.  For those looking for a new camera that has these new features in it this one it just perfect and not a bad price either.  I am very happy with my purchase.
1740312,0.0,"I set up this drive with the intention of using it for my photo archives as well as a local network backup of my laptops. The idea of media streaming was also appealing. I set it up on my network without too much difficulty, put the clients on the PCs, etc. It hummed along with very light use for a year or so. Then, it began making a weird noise. I shut it down, and, when I restarted it, I got the ""7 red flashes of death"" indicating hard drive failure. Buffalo tech support answered promptly on a Saturday (kudos for that) but confirmed that the HD was dead and that the one year warranty had expired.

This wasn't a cheap drive, and the fact that it bricked itself after less than 18 months is really poor performance. It's particularly bad since the proper use of these drives is to serve as backup for presumably more vulnerable PC drives.

1476683,1.0,"I got this fan as a second exhaust fan for my HAF X case... It fits 100%, and is extremely quiet. It was difficult to get the top of the case on with all the cables in their default position with this fan in place though, and it still has a tiny gap in the top because of it. This is a design flaw of the HAF X and not this fan though.

One way I was able to get the top back on was to cut off the top mount of this fan where the cables were running by so they would slow down along the side of the fan snugly and fit... This worked for me and all is well.

The fan is quiet, I cannot hear them unless I put my ear up to them and even then it is not very loud. It moves a lot of air and does it's job. I replaced the LED's with white LED's and faced them down into my case, but thats just because I am not a big fan of color LED's and prefer to just use the lights to display my components and to help me spot any dust problems! I wish Noctua made a 200mm fan, but this is just as quiet as theirs fans so it works for me.

I have yet to try the third... I don't expect it to be worth the effort.

I had it about 3 weeks and the drive started to fail. During normal use it would click repeatedly.

Data transfer is slow.less than 20mb/s when writing, dropped lower than 17 at times.
Takes a minute or so for the drive to be recognized.

I bought this drive because i saw a low price for alot of space, but didn't do the research.

Imagine my frustration after I came home and popped the SD card into my laptop to view the footage just to realize the camera actually stopped recording over a year ago! Yes, I never checked but the red dot on the screen is blinking at all time which is an indicator the recording is in progress. There's no warning or heads up to let you know there's something wrong with the camera. I'm not sure why it stopped recording. Could be because the SD card is full and it doesn't want to write over it, could be something else. In any event, I would expect to be notified if something is wrong or at least for the camera to stop acting like everything is right. This is THE reason you buy these cams, so in case of accident you have some sort of a proof. What good is it if you cannot rely on it?"

This is my first radar detector so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I am impressed.

I was very impressed - I'm sure this will save my ass in the future.

I followed the instructions when trying to connect to Bluetooth. There was no mention in the instructions that an 8-digit 'Passcode' would be flashed on the screen that would have to be entered (still not sure if it was to be entered on the Bluetooth keyboard or the on-screen keyboard) to complete the pairing. I started to write down the passcode when it disappeared from the screen while I was still 3 or 4 digits shy of the complete code. Assuming that if I did the pairing routine again, the code would appear again and could complete the process. Wrong!  This time a screen came up and asked me to enter the code I did not have. Jelly Comb could said the code was not 'fixed' and could not help me find what it was or where it was stored. Let me add now that the Jelly Comb person I dealt with was a pleasure to work with and I have no doubt that 'Starry' was as disappointed as I was that we could not get it to work.

But there is one other benefit of the zipper that not many have mentioned.  It makes it really easy to know which bud goes in which ear.

When I tried formatting the cards (2-pack) in either camera, they came up as FULL. No shots available.
I called Lexar asking if there was a compatibility problem with these (older) cameras. They asked me to return them and they'd check them out.
No answer about compatibility, just returned cards.
Still don't work.
So I'd like to exchange them for equivalent cards of, say, 16GB per card, because I know 16GB cards work in these cameras.

After having similar trouble with a HOSA right angle adaptor, right out of the box, HOSA is simply on my personal do not buy list.

A commenter asked me to name a better choice, and it just so happens that I recently purchased one ... the answer is ""DiMarzio"" ... it's not cheap, but the difference in sound quality is like night and day.  The HOSA, now destined for the trash, is very small gauge wire, and there appears to be no twisting or shielding (which good audio cables need) ... I guess you get what you pay for.

Addendum:  I discovered something about HOSA cables at a friends studio ... if you look for the HOSA ""Elite Series"" cables, they are high quality good sounding cables, they cost ten times as much as these cheap throw away ones, but they are actually decent sounding cables.  Again, don't buy these cheap cables for any serious audio applications, look for the the ""Elite Series"", and open your wallet a lot wider."

Fortunately for this company I did. Here's why:

They are standard earbuds, in the sense that they come with 6 or 8 sets of various sized rubber ear cushions that are so popular now. Most of those are too big for me, so I was happy to have a selection to choose from. What I really liked about these was the ass and the volume. Good stuff. For ten bucks, absolutely. For fifty bucks? Hell no.

They have an angle I have not seen in earbuds I have bought over the past two years. This makes them fit better. They stay in your ears. Most earbuds I have tried don't, and it pisses me off. Their construction is identical to Apple's (which is ""okay but not great."" But then if my old Apple earbuds were not fifty bucks I would buy THEM for ten bucks instead. These are great for the price. Don't expect BOSE or Beats for ten bucks. But these will deliver music or spoken (podcasts, talk radio, etc) just fine.

The spool cover/sleeve doesn't seal to the spool base worth a damn.  You have to pick up the spool by the base.
If you try to lift it by the cover sleeve you are probably going to drop your DVDs all over the floor.
To some, this might not seem like a big deal but depending on where and how you store your DVDs, always having
to lift from the base can be tedious. I'll have to put a 'LIFT FROM THE BOTTOM' warning label on the sleeve and hope I never overlook it. This is the first Amazon Basics product that I have to give a thumbs down. I'm not really upset though. Amazon is usually a hit.

They have a tendency to be a bit BRIGHT. A bit of work with the receiver and I have them dialed in to where they match up well with the other 1000's and the sub. I think the primary use is stated clearly, HT. But I have read how others have used these as computer monitors. In that capacity, I think these would tire me out all on their own. They do their part perfectly well and in that capacity I like them a lot. But they only fill part of the frequency spectrum and NEED a sub and a bit of mid range from the 1000's to help them blend in. I am very very happy with them in my HT set up. But they are not stand alone speakers."

These replaced a set of Bose Companion 5 speakers/subwoofer.  One of the cables went out after several years of use and thought it might be time for a replacement set and get rid of that subwoofer for my computer set up.  I have a nice 7.1 surround sound set in my man cave and didn't want another bulky sub somewhere.  I looked at these, Harman Kardon Soundsticks III and Audioengine 2+ and 5+ and quickly settled on these because of the looks and the price point of under $200.  I'm so glad I did.  They look and sound spectacular and the sound is accurate.  I will not get into specs because you can read those for yourself.  Took less than 10 minutes to unwrap and take out of the box.  They come nicely packaged and the remote works flawless.  I was a little concerned about the Bluetooth streaming quality because I read a few reviews that said the sound quality went way down when they used it.

This is not an old Laptop, matter of fact, it has 16GB of RAM, a Nvidia 1060 Graphics card and was purchased as a new model late 2017. If I listen to music or video without this plugged in, then the voices are clear and the audio is loud, but if I plug this in, the audio turns down very low and I have to turn the volume to max.

It provides wider spaces for 4 AC adapter plugs, but if any of those plugs have their tines at 90 degrees (to avoid interfering with other plugs on a standard duplex outlet), they won't fit anywhere but at the end of each row, and will also hang over the end slightly.

Sorry if this review should be for the Lacie burner instead of these, but the whole LightScribe thing in general just makes me so angry.  I wasted hours (and at least 5 discs) getting error messages at 35% or pulling out the disc and not being able to tell that it had printed anything at all.

4694403,0.0,"While this review in no way reflects the seller - the device was packaged well and delivered within two days - the watch itself is junk, at least for me, using a Galaxy S5.  I was able to pair the watch with my phone, albeit briefly, but frequent disconnects render this device useless.  Frequent ""Sorry, apk exception, will exit"" errors from the btnotification app as well as every other bluetooth notifier app I could find in the play store.  I wasn't expecting much from a device that cost less than $20 but I'm disappointed, never-the-less, that I wasted money that I could've used to purchase an analog watch that actually works.  Save your money and buy an analog watch or spend more and get one of the mainstream branded smart watches that are of better quality and will more than likely function.  I will update this review if I find a solution that works."

It has no cable to communicate with your computer.  It has no place to plug in a usb cable.  It doesn't work with any kind of power management.

The main reason to have a UPS is to gracefully have your computer shut down when the power goes out.  This doesn't do that.  It can't!  It is very important for a computer to not just shut off by losing power.  It can scramble the registry and make a new operating system install required.  If your computer is only EVER on when you are sitting at it, then fine, get this.  That way, if the power goes off, you can manually shut down your computer before the battery dies.  If you EVER leave your computer on unattended, this is next to worthless.
Spend a few dollars more and get the next best one, whatever model that is.

Why they even sell this is really beyond my comprehension.  AMazon needs to prominently warn people about the lack of this common feature.  Now I have to deal with returning these two that I ordered.  that's kind of a PITA."

I seriously had no experience with Marshall earphones but I currently own and use Shure SE210, Sennheiser CX300ii, and Denon AHC 300. The Shures sounded the most flat with very little bass, the Sennheiser sounded warmer with deep bass but more recessed midrange, and the Denon sounded reasonably bassy for bassheads with average midrange and highs. That and being a dual driver earphone, it had soundstage.  Out of the 3, the Denon fit my preference by being ""fun"" sounding. Along came the Marshall Mode which had large amounts of bass impact but not overwhelming, detailed highs without being shrill, and decent mids. It felt almost like a middle ground for all my earphones. The seal is incredible and the mic is pretty crisp for taking calls. The only downside is small soundstage but still great for a single driver earphone. Works with most genres."

NudeAudio's marketing campaign was brilliant, but since then we have received nothing but empty promises: not the original product nor any of the add-ons. The company said multiple times ""reach out to us if you haven't received your product"", then ignored all messages, whether via email or direct on Kickstarter, all while apparently doing a brisk business here on Amazon. I would call them scum of the earth, except that I'm pretty sure pond scum serves a useful biological purpose.

Should you decide to buy a NudeAudio product, assume going in that there will be absolutely no after-sale support if and when the item later proves to be defective or otherwise needs service (a pretty good likelihood, based on multiple reviews I've read).

After that, it intermittently stopped working with my TV provider.  The video would stop, but the audio would continue.  After thoroughly troubleshooting on my own, I ended up contacting Pioneer and my TV provider.  Neither could help.  Although the problem was never officially diagnosed or resolved, I believe the problem was with the latest version of HDCP.  Pioneer doesn't offer firmware updates for this unit.  So, I finally gave up on the unit all together and replaced it with a Denon.  So far, so good with it.  Having nothing else to with the Pioneer unit, I relocated it into another room in my house where I could use it to just play Pandora.  I could not successfully connect to Pandora.  After some googling, I found that this is a known issue.  It also doesn't work well with AirPlay.  Yes.  It works.  But, it keeps losing its connection and the music stops.

They claim the distance can't be more than 4mm, but that's pretty impossible to measure in advance.  2 complete sets might be enough, but I seriously doubt 4 layers would be very thermally conductive.  Also, there were surface mounted components in that motherboard area that might have been damaged if the pads applied too much pressure.

What they do not tell you is that when you plug it in to a computer, it only shows you a small portion of the drive... that is to say it DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS THE RECORDINGS YOU MADE WITH IT. It allows you to copy files onto it, and it will play some of them (it does not seem to handle many of today's more popular codecs such as H.264), but the recordings you made from it are not accessible at all.

Recordings you make using the DV or video ports are stored in a partition that is NOT visible to the computer.

The saddest thing is that the board _feels_ amazing. I want it to work in the worst possible way. Sadly, none of the ports on any of my machines across three different cables have done the trick. And I have no idea how to get a replacement.**

I bought an ASSIA charger and 12 2800MAH batteries.  I'd have 4 in the camera and 4 as standby.  The batteries didn't last long and I was always recharging.  But with these new-type rechargeables, it's a different story.  The POWERGENIX NIZn rechargeable batteries just last and last and you have to be amazed at the longevity between charges.  Because they are superior to any rechargeable battery that I've used for my digicam, I bought 4 more for my wife's digicam although it uses 2 AAs.

I called Sony hoping they would honor my 2 year full warranty but it had run out the month before, so they said ""tough luck"" and ""you can buy a new logic board"". Like I can afford that. Tried different hard drives, removed and added and removed different memory chips, restored system...no luck. Just blue screens with video card error. So this computer is now just a paperweight. My previous Sony had the screen die and the one before that the fans went out. Conclusion: Sony quality is almost non-existent. Buy a Mac or HP instead.

We have 4 cell phones in our house but this Jabra Drive will pair with only one of the four - on a good day.

The third phone it refuses to pair with is a HTC MyTouch 4G Smartphone. That HTC will connect with my high quality audio system in the car and sounds great that way but absolutely refuses to connect to this Jabra.

That said, this Jabra DOES work with the Trac Fone we have but the audio is bad bad bad - both speaking and listening.

Put them in the camera, it won't power up.  Remove them and replace them and it powers on fine.  Check them with a battery tester, 3 of 4 check fine, one shows no charge.  Check it again a few seconds later, and it shows a full charge.  THESE ARE UNRELIABLE JUNK.

Made a big mistake getting this again here is why. I placed it in same spot in attic. No matter how hard I tried to get it to connect and amplify, it would not. I could obtain channel 4 & 7 with no power to it, but single was shaky. I could not get CBS. After frustrating myself for about 3 weeks, I noticed my 30 days had expired by one day. I selected a much cheaper antenna and put it in the attic. My signal strength went from 30 to 73, and I started getting all my missing stations. The Lava antenna must be bad.

6336144,0.0,"After losing a freezer full of yummy stuff over a hot weekend thanks to a tripped breaker, I replaced the breaker and bought this along with the remote base unit so that I could actually hear the alert (since this is a garage located freezer).

It is pretty straightforward, you plug it in, turn on sound options and you are good to go.  That is until I tried for an hour to get it synced with the base unit on the other side of a sheetrock wall not a foot away.  No matter how I tried, following the instructions of both the remote and base units to the litter, they would not sync.  This is very disappointing, especially considering the sky high cost of both units.

Now I could have lived with just using the remote unit, except being located in the garage, I need a longer alert.  After testing I found it would only beep for about a minute, not nearly long enough for someone inside the house to notice it.  I need it to beep until the batteries are dead if it is not going to sync with the indoor base unit.

As a result, I cannot recommend these and both the base unit and this remote unit are going back to Amazon and I will buy a competing product."

338170,0.0,"I had a large Swiss Gear backpack without wheels that I had used for at least two years.  I travel a lot, and thought that I would appreciate the wheels at the airport, etc.  I also see a lot of JanSport bags around the airport and thought since they were so popular that they must be of good quality.  I was wrong.

While I do appreciate the quality wheels and handle, I'm not so impressed with the quality of the rest of the bag.  The material is much thinner and ""flimsier"" than my Swiss Gear bag, the computer ""sleeve"" allows a large laptop to flop around, it is hard to get stuff in and out of, the section for pens/pencils/office items is way too small with flimsy/cheap pockets that won't even hold a pen/pencil securely, there are no real external pockets to hold items that are used often (like a cell phone/tickets, etc.) and the zippers are almost impossibly stiff and get stuck constantly.  I tried lubricating the zippers, but it's more a design flaw than a zipper problem.  The ""flap"" that covers the zippers constantly gets caught in the zipper.  The backpack straps are uncomfortable and cumbersome to attach/reattach/stow.  I really don't see the quality here, and especially for the price I paid.  I'm going back to my old worn out Swiss Gear bag.  I think I could have bought something at Wal Mart that was higher quality."

I have been a happy Netgear customer in the past, and am technical enough to keep both home and small office wireless networks running fine, but this model has a hardware problem that Netgear tech support has finally acknowledged, but for which they are not providing an adequate fix.  As others have mentioned, the router will often drop connectivity, and rebooting is the only solution.  I bought one, had these problems start (luckily within the 90 day tech support window), and returned the router to Netgear (at my expense) in exchange for another one, which demonstrated the SAME problem less than 24 hours after installation.  After yet another long call to India the latest tech support rep acknowledged that lots of these models are having the same problem, and upgrading to the latest firmware (which I did immediately upon installing both of these routers) won't fix it, so her solution was... send this one back (AGAIN at my expense) and they would send me yet another one of the SAME model, which she (for no defensible reason) assures me will work.

First, the pictures of the wireless jack:  They don't show you that the underside is where you plug it into your wall socket.  The problem is that the plug is so huge that it may cover the entire wall socket.  If you have two sockets, and depending on how those sockets are arranged, you may lose access to the second one.

So, ""I'll connect it to a surge protector or socket multiplier of some kind,"" you say.  The manual tells you not to do that.  I don't know why, but a surge protector probably interferes with the AC signal this device sends on your house wiring.  Just a guess.

Then, the manual doesn't tell you if Caller ID signals are sent from the phone company jack to the jack you extended with this device.  You can find out empirically...but I never got that far.

Plus it delivers the same protection that zagg has been able to provide with the same guarantee and warranty. The surface feels more like glass and it's definitely a great improvement over the original shield. Now for the not so great part....

The back shield is unfortunately absolutely horrible to take off your device. Upon an attempt to take off the shield from the back of my iPad it left spots of glue all over it and I had to apply so much force take it off that i nearly broke my new iPad. It seems that the shield's adhesive is much too strong for the back plate and IT WILL be a nightmare to take off. Once off you will be spending days trying to remove the residue of the adhesive which is quite annoying and time consuming. The adhesive residue that the shield left behind was so stuck on that I had to resort to a much more abrasive scrubber and it ended up discoloring the grey on the back. That was the first and last time that I ever put one of these invisible shields on a surface that isn't glass. I suggest you simply buy the front face shield for the glass and avoid damaging the back surface of your iPad with the full body shield. Good luck!"

2161214,1.0,"If did a thorough review of all the rechargeable speakers systems, both the small and the tiny ones. I decided for this model and a X mini II capsule. Both had good reputation and ratings, are rechargeable and seemed to be loud yet with acceptable sounds quality. With so many reviews for the iTour POP I was wondering if these reviews where actually true...well, after trying both, and evaluating how the sounded, I ordered two more iTour-POPs and decided to do away with the X Capsule Mini (while good, it doesn't even score close to the sound of the iTour).

Pros
- Expect to be surprised by the sound quality considering its size
- Hours of music with one charge
- Much better build than the average capsule: more solid that the alternatives
- Sound processing gives some kind of fill effect. Doesn't seem mono at all!
- Not at all expensive
- Easy to transport (no exposed parts that can break)

Cons
- Audio cable seems fragile. I would have preferred an audio input so I could use my own cable.
- Audio cable is really REALLY short (like 6cm or 2 inches)

It really sounds AMAZING for the size. It just seem the right compromise between quality, size, price and build you can find. This unit is not at all a toy, but a seriously sounding device enthusiast, nerds, techies and grandma will love. If don't expect it to compete against your $200 Bose (it won't!!!), but do expect something that sounds rich enough to be pleasant and not only ""mini"", then this marvel is as good as it gets.

Too funny, i love how people vote as unhelpful reviews on amazon to which they disagree. I gave a ton of details and reasons as to why they are bad yet 2 people already voted it as unhelpful. Funny.

I have been using in ear headphones for years, guess I am just used to ones that are higher quality from Shure."

I applied 4 applications to my REI thin, leather palmed, all-season gloves. And they still don't work for the intended purpose.
The gloves have no insulation at all, they're very thin, and they're not really waterproof either.
When i applied the product, I saturated the whole finger -- so that when I removed my hand, my finger was wet with the black substance from the bottle.
Just as instructed on the box, I used a hair dryer to dry in between applications.

No dice.

For a day or so it would work moderately and then several days later, nothing at all. Super lame. Expensive product too.

My only hunch is that this works best for thin cotton gloves or 'fashion' type items -- but not for even basic outdoor gloves.
Does not live up to its name ANYglove."

Although this is not a complaint in itself, and believe it's not an error on the part of amazon, I do think it should be considered.

I did this following a suggestion about adding a battery to my order, which was on the same page when confirming the order for the camera and other items.
I did wanted the extra battery, it's just that I ordered the wrong model (and in turn the wrong battery charger) being suggested by the mentioned page. SEE ITEM MODELS BELOW.
I corrected this yesterday, ordering the right battery and charger.
I hope to hear from you soon.

5871046,1.0,"This computer is so good that I regularly switch it out with my MacBook Pro retina.

Where I live, we use solar a lot so I keep two laptops around all the time: the MacBook Pro and this one.  When the MacBook dies, I switch over to this one so I can keep working.

I have to use these computers for work online and while the Mac is a Lexus, this little Toyota Corolla still gets most of the work done.

While it's weak at my hobby photography, it does most day-to-day things like internet and movie watching just fine.

It's not quite a retina display but it's close.  And the sound is the best laptop I've ever heard.

Whenever I watch movies or listen to music on a laptop, I prefer this to the Apple.  It has a wonderful sound and the screen for movies is very comparable.

I am looking to buy another one, just to have around.  It's really good.

Keyboard and track pad don't compare to Mac but they are SUPERIOR to that damn Windows 10 laptop I hardly ever use which cost $550."

The other annoyance is that on both pairs so far the volume buttons work, but the center button does not start/stop music. This has been the same on my past 2 iPhones, so it is not my phone.

The shape of the get part inserted into the ear is not your standard round gel pad; rather it comes to a soft curved point at the top/bottom how ever you choose to insert it into the ear. I have found the sound quality is the best I have ever enjoyed with this rather unusual shape configuration. From a comfort standpoint you are not even aware that that there is anything in your ear.

The second reason I ordered this product was the length of the cord, it is longer than the industry standard and I did not want to pull my I-Pad off the stool next to the edge of my bed. I have not had one problem/event where this has happened. The cord/connection is long enough that it easily reaches my pillow from the stool with length leftover.

3623610,1.0,"Superb product!
I'm using it to connect my Vega graphics card with my Samsung 1080p 120Hz TV.
To make things clear, TV can't take 120Hz signal from PC since it doesn't have HDMI 2.0 ports. That's obviously shame since panel is 120Hz native. Obviously Samsung made blunder  for not using at least one HDMI 2.0, but those aren't common on 1080p TVs after all.
The reason I'm using this adapter instead of Vega's own HDMI output is because I have 4K monitor as primary display on another DP out.
Thing is, when using DP on 4K monitor, and HDMI on 1080p TV, some quirk things do happen. Those are eliminated when only DP outputs are used. Simply OS and software stack sees only DP being used, it's up to adapter to do it's thing and translate that signal to be compliant with HDMI protocol in order to get displayed on TV.

Good music to all!"
1190096,1.0,"I purchased this battery as an additional battery when I ordered my new camera.  I didn't want to be caught with a picture opportunity, a dead battery, and no spare.
I've just returned from a vacation where the number of photographs that I took was sufficient to require swapping out and recharging batteries a number of times. I am very pleased to say that I saw no difference in the performance of this additional battery when compared to that of the original from Canon. I could take the same number of pictures and it took that same time to charge.  Whether it will retain its performance for the same number of recharges as the original as it gets older is something only time will tell, but, for the present, I am very satisfied."

1455133,0.0,"Warning; if you are looking for a case for Canon 5DII, this will not fit.  It is made of very thin material; much thiner than the camera wrap that I am currently using. Despite the list of cameras that it supposedly will fit, it isn't wide enough for the camera body let alone long enough to accommodate a decent lens like the 24-105L IS.  This would probably fit the Rebel models with a standard small kit lens, but it isn't nearly big enough for the larger semi-pro models.  Even if it were, it doesn't provide much protection."

When I chose one for home, I wanted one with adequate power reserves, functional design, reasonable cost and good software interface.

  - The physical design is flexible, functional and the build seems good.
  - The UPS has an easy to read display for input voltage, battery condition, minutes available, etc.
  - The software setup and status software is intuitive and flexible
  - The connections, outlets and controls are well labeled and easy to access
  - Cost vs Power is competitive with anyone
  - Packaging provided very good protection to the product
  - Replacement batteries are readily available and cost less than $20.00

1847881,0.0,"I purchased these so I had a ready supply for my new heart rate monitor during sleep. On my old heart rate monitor the batteries would last a couple of months and then I would scurry around trying to find another. With the delivery of these ten I thought that I would be covered for years. Not the case. The first one lasted about 3 nights, about 24 hours. The second another two days. By the third I had measured the standing starting voltage on the battery: 3.3 volts. Three days later I received a warning that the battery was low again. I measured the voltage: 2.9 volts. At this point I wasn't certain whether my new heart rate monitor was to blame or the battery. So I went out and purchased a pair of Duracell batteries and installed one. That was a week ago and the heart rate monitor is still running well. I believe these WAMA batteries I received are defective."

421402,0.0,"I figured it was to good to be true.  A 4x digital zoom is bad, should be optical.  Of course you kinda get what you pay for and in this case you get a camera that has pan, tilt and zoom.  The only problem is the picture quality is very bad.  I have a non PTZ camera from another company and the picture quality is excellent.  I guess that adding the other features somehow affects the picture quality.  That is unless you spend around $500 - %6000 and up for the camera."

3416739,0.0,"I previously had a Microsoft Ergo 4000, and had liked quite a bit, but had switched to the Kensis Advantage for most of my work. For home and away from my main keyboard, I was looking for a device that was narrower than the 4000, and offered some of the ergo benefits. I liked how this keyboard didn't have the numpad, but was worried of the wireless, since I work and live in a high-RF environment.

I was right to be worried.

This keyboard is next to useless if you have any more than a slight amount of RF noise in your work environment. Maybe 1 out of 20 key presses actually registered with the computer (even after replacing the batteries, positioning the USB dongle in a bunch of different ways and with different extenders, and a handful of other attempted fixes that shouldn't have been necessary). The keys were comfortable, and the magnetic negative-tilt attachment was great, but the wireless interface was unacceptable. If Microsoft had a wired version of this keyboard, it would be perfect, but as-is, it's garbage."

Still has incredible reception despite all the stuff in the way. Why do I keep in the closet? It's pretty ugly. Looks like it should be a outdoor antenna. But hey, its functionality definitely beats out its aesthetics. I am very happy with this product, and will buy it again if I'm in need of another."

Replacements for the little plastic case that my original battery came in was sold in multiples of 4 or 6 at about $2.50 per case.  This memory card wallet  purchased for $0.97 (including free shipping) from Cameta Camera stores and protects the NP-BN1 batteries at a fraction of that cost and looks good too.  Nice velcro fastener and even a belt loop to attach to a camera neck strap or gadget bag strap.
I do not intend to use this wallet for Compact Flash memory but I did slip an old compact flash card into the empty pouch with the two NP-BN1 batteries in the other two pouches just to see if it would fit, and it does."

The warranty says I pay for shipping 2 ways this thing weighs 50 lbs. I also pay for all parts and labor. Shipping labor and parts exceeds the value of the dehumidifier. So I have lost about 190 dollars for 11 months. This is the dumbest purchase ever."

I decided on these JBuds J2 earbuds and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  In my opinion they sound just as good as the Klipsch pair that i bought and are much cheaper.  They fit great and the amount of cord noise is much lower than my old Zune premium earbuds.

Pros:
- Great Fit (3 different size silicone earbuds)
- Excellent sound and great bass
- Very Comfortable
- Low Price

Cons:
- None so far

Overall I would absolutely recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a great set of noise-isolating earbuds with low cord noise and do not want to break the bank."

Setup and installation of old software was uneventful. I had no problems at all. Installed secondary drives. SATA and SSD with no problems whatsoever. I know this PC is not top of the line but it will do for me. Only problem was using my old Logitech Mouse, Keyboard combo that I dearly loved. New PC did not have proper connections for it. So will have to be satisfied with those included. Some say they got wired keyboard and mouse but I didnt. Just simple but adequate mouse and keyboard. I will probably replace sometime in the future. Also want to add DVD drive but find not enough internal cables. I will try to figure this out......................Dont like one drive.............

Very disappointed on trying this brand with all the good reviews I had read wonder if they had issues later on or was this a problem with the board they used and then dumped it or used very cheap manufactured boards?  Called Onkyo support and they covered the HDMI Processor board and labor. Now again I have 1 HDMI port not working for sound just a picture moved it to another port the sound works some some channels or partially or not at all.  There have been a lot of bad reviews on this model wrote to Onkyo and see what they want to do now. it's not quite 6 months since it was repaired.

The Nano 4th generation comes in great colors, is light, slim, yet has a big enough screen for your kid to see the album artwork for the songs they are listening to. The controls are big enough for little hands, and my 10 year old loves how you can shuffle a song just by shaking it. (I think that's that cool too:-)

There are a variety of games available in the iTunes store for the Nano which are age appropriate as well. All in all this is a good investment for the responsible tween in your house who loves music!"

I use a 16 GB class 6 SDHC card and even when the camera is on a tripod and taping a stationery area, the video is very jerky. I think it's the image stabilization that's causing the problem, but not sure. The video twitches up and down at a regular rate making it unwatchable.

When I move the video camera, following a moving subject I'm recording, the video is very pixelated and blocky. Again, it's totally unwatchable.

The Guru's that crowdfunded this toy are riding the wave. They have their own little pyramid scheme going that is dependent on marketing and an initial income stream. Throw in some soft deception and especially soft emotional deception about the ability to recover lost pets and you have it. They will ride the wave until the product returns and consumer discourse causes its collapse. Their true income stream long term will be the return on investment vehicles where they park their initial income from sales.

I am experienced with computers, and setting them up, or changing the hardware.  I installed this in my HP Omen, and it fit just fine.  However, when it came time to listen to music, it was greatly distorted. I tried multiple times, with the driver from Creative's website that states it is for Windows 10 64 bit.  I am using a Logitech 5.1 speaker system, and even with just one of the plugs installed, I do not get a clean sound.  Something is causing the sound to distort greatly, no matter the volume setting.

I can not recommend this to anyone with Windows 10"

Even then, there will be pretty ridiculous recycle times, even when using professional batteries like the Eneloops. In all other circumstances (event, wedding, etc), they are absolutely garbage. In fact, they heat up so hotly that if you are using anything other than pro-grade batteries, the cover on the battery casings will actually WARP OFF of the battery. I'd call that a dangerous situation.

The UI is terrible, too. Difficult to read, even in the best lighting conditions, filled with overly-complex information and confusing menus. An admirable first effort, but definitely not ready for prime time."

1686191,1.0,"When I first set up this subwoofer, I knew I had to do some adjustments to get the sound just right. To be honest, it was a disappointment at the start where the bass sounded boomy and out of phase. I started to let the subwoofer do its break-in period and sat there letting my ears guide my thinking. The bass started to clear up a little, but still with some boominess. I then cut the crossover down to 60hz and flipped the phase switch to 180 out. This helped tremedously and I was smiling after that. The best tweak I did was to remove the rubber stick-on foots that they provide with the sub, then 3m double-backed taped custom stainless steel spikes to the hard plastic feet. The bass was a total joy to listen to after that and matches my older home system very well. Room size is 14' x 30' x 9' ceiling.

I was so frustrated I went until next buy and they didn't have ONE - NOT ONE Bluetooth FM transmitter. I went online to Amazon and saw the amazing reviews on this. It's so easy to set up I did it while I was driving (I knows,  I know) and it automatically connects now to my phone the second I get in.

It simply couldn't compete with the < $200 kit lens.

Also shocking was the amount of distortion in the Sigma. Objects weren't just misshapen at the edges, they looked smeared. Even when shooting landscapes the distortion was very noticeable ... And virtually un-correctable.

Cons: it is heavier, it is made of two parts that snap together so there is always the chance for them to break in two when the Ipod is dropped. The bad news is I already dropped my Ipod today with this case on. The good news is, this case protected it and did not break in two, even though it fell on tiles.

Continuing on the disapointment train...this cable is unnecessarily thick; proprer EMI sheilding like on the much cheaper Amazon Basic HDMI cable is more than adaquate and thin like it should be.

644224,0.0,"Avoid this product!

I bought this for my daughter and have had nothing but problems with it.  First, it doesn't get good HD reception, despite adding a high-quality antenna.  It switches between HD and analog, causing the song to jump back and forth due to the different delays between the two signals.  It is unlistenable.  Second, the optical output fails frequently, generating a huge amount of high-volume static.  Resetting the unit, which takes a minute or so, fixes the problem most of the time, but not always (why does it even have a reset feature?).  Third, the build quality is poor---lightweight, loose connectors, etc.

Bottom line: it doesn't hold a signal and is unreliable.

Addendum: Although I discovered the problem on day one, I thought the reset fixed it.  I learned from my daughter yesterday that it did not, she has to reset it all of the time, and it sometimes doesn't work.  Now, because we are three days outside of Amazon's 30-day return window, they refuse to give me a full refund.  Very disappointing."

The 1st was an irulu 10 inch tablet that had a mind of it's own as it self-launched apps and just typed any letters it wanted to. Froze and crashed as well.

The 2nd was a Zenithink C92 that appeared to have 2 cracks/blisters in the screen. It, too, crashed...a lot. When I was putting it back in it's box to ship back to Amazon, I noticed a lot more cracks/blisters in the screen.

I had each tablet 1 day!

Well, not to be outdone, the Archos 101 G9 Turbo I got yesterday, was sent back today. It was totally dead, would not turn on. When I connected the power plug, the charging LED would light literally for 1 second, then die. I kept it plugged in overnight expecting a fully charged tablet with a flashing LED indicating so.

All I saw was nada. No LED, would not turn on.

Wish I could provide a review on the features, but kind of hard to do when it's dead.

I'm debating on ordering another tablet from Amazon. Last year, the very 1st tablet I ever ordered from Amazon was a goner after a couple of days! It went back, the next one, my Arnova 8 G2, is the only one that lasted more than a couple of days.

So, the math is I've had a total of 3 out of 4 tablets from Amazon that were severely defective.

3257829,0.0,"Summary:

Amazon was GREAT!  They offered to take this piece of crap out of my house at no charge to me!  The product was terrible and should not even be on the market as a router if this particular piece is any indication of their line.  And, my research revealed this is a problem with the entire Archer line.

Details:

On quality:  I had to restart this thing AGAIN so that I could connect to the internet to write this review!  I lose network connectivity several times a day on ethernet and from time to time on the 5Ghz band and the 2.4 Ghz band.  I restart my router three to five times a day since I got it.  It's actually WORSE than the one I upgraded from!  If the old one had simultaneous dual band, I would just go back to it.  Windows told me that I had winsock errors and protocols were not installed.  That led to a week and a half of trouble shooting and ultimately this review.

On security:  I've never tested a router so horrible in my life and I was on the internet back in the days of the 14 baud modems.  It failed the GRC test in ways so spectacular that I didn't think a modern piece of equipment could possibly fail.  I'll upload pictures of the security scans and the settings while the scans occurred."

Don't be fooled by reviews saying they are blurred or soft. Most of these people claim this because they are shooting handheld or mirror slap not because of actual lens fault. You have to have a STEADY hand to shoot with a zoom like this. That's why if you can go the VR Nikon 18-200 go for it BUT this lens works great too, just watch your shooting stance and you can get some great handheld shots and works Excellent on a tripod. As with any zoom really watch for mirror slap. I would say avoid the 1/60 to 3secs exposures. Enjoy your new, nice, small, sharp, lens I do.

PS. on the comment of this not being a 300mm focal on a Dslr. I actually did a side by side test and it seemed pretty dang gone close to me when I sat a Nikon 70-300 to the 200mm focal length and took the same shot. Maybe they just got confused."

2616747,1.0,"I was initially hesitant about getting such a ""big"" case for my iPad with Retina Display.  However I am glad that I made this purchase.  The case itself adds considerable bulk and weight to the iPad.  That is something to consider when deciding on which iPad case you buy.  Please also consider that the extra weight is worth it when you're protecting a $500+ device.

The Gumdrop Tech iPad case is not the most beautiful case available, but it does have the ""tire track"" design that gives you a better grip on the device, regardless of if you're holding it horizontally or vertically.

The case fits like a glove and all of the ports are covered by thick rubber.  I have an additional screen protector on my iPad and the case still fit without my having to remove that screen protector.

No case will completely protect your device if dropped or mishandled, but this case will give you peace of mind from the occasional accident.  And remember, what's an extra $60 spent to protect your $500+ device?"

I will say that it felt good in the hand and is about a medium sized mouse. Not full size, but not a ""travel"" mouse either. The rubber on the thumbrest felt good.

The ""storage"" slot for the USB receiver on the botton is decent, but it doesn't seem to fully fit or lock into place. You could easily misplace it.

2308772,0.0,"This mount comes in two pieces. A base that you use with 3M Command Strips to mount to a surface, and the iPad holder. Advertising this as a ""fridge mount"" is misleading since that usually connotes a magnetic mount. Since I got this through Amazon Vine, I didn't research it. There was no risk for me to try it.

There's nothing special about a refrigerator in this mount since you could also mount it to anything to which the Command Strips will stick. These strips are semi-permanent attachments. You attach the double-sided adhesive to the back of the mount then place it against the surface that you want. If you decide to move it, you pull the tabs on the strips to release them. However, pulling the tabs effectively destroys the strips. Be sure that you want to put it where you place it the first time.

The picture on Amazon falsely implies that there is a protective cover for the iPad screen, but that's merely a representation of tilting the iPad away from the mount. I was interesting in a cover to protect my iPad from whatever might be on my hands while I'm cooking.

If you want to mount this permanently, this limitation might be fine. However, I expected something that I could easily remove and move around. For me, this is a fine idea falsely labelled and not something that I need or want."

4932415,1.0,"I was given a review sample of this tablet and keyboard case. Lower price tablets are something I have approached with caution over the years; truthfully, most of the time in this category up until very recently you really (don't) get what you (don't) pay for. However, this tablet and the 7 inch Fire I just bought are both so good - quick, reliable, full featured pocket-sized Androids with quad core processors and sd card slots - and SO inexpensive, that I feel retroactively ripped off by some of the other tablets I've owned.

This tablet doesn't have the screen resolution of a MeMo or iPad, and the camera is not a huge 8-12 mp DSR substitute, but it does everything you would expect of a 7 inch tablet. It's Google certified, and setting it up with all your Google stuff is super easy. The speakers are good, and the video quality is decent. Touch is responsive, and the screen is oleophobic. It is nice and sturdy, as well.

This would be a four-plus star tablet at about twice what it costs. As it is, it is five stars, no question.

It was then able to play the BR movie that failed prior to the firmware update (I only kept one of the BR movies that would not work - all the other BR movies were returned to the stores where they were purchased). However, It will not play any BR movies or DVDs in 5.1 surround sound anymore. It will only play them in stereo - even though it says 5.1 on the BR player options and BR disk menu options - the receiver showed 5.1 prior to firmware update - now stereo only! It has also been very glitchy with navigating DVD movies after the firmware update. I feel this has been a major waste of time and money!"

I purchased the 2nd generation of the Samsung hub when I purchased a 'smart' garage door opener (not made by Samsung) and they worked flawlessly together. Through power outages and a router replacement I can always count on them to work. I decided to pick up a fan controller. Once again, with the exception of one minor hiccup, it responds through the app and through my Amazon echo. I decided to branch out and purchased 3 open/ close sensors. They work at about 10 feet from the hub. My hub is located at the bottom of the stairs. The 3 sensors were placed on doors upstairs. They have never reliably worked. I can reset them right next to the hub, take them to the desired location, and they work fine, for a while. Unfortunately, there is no feedback if a sensor is offline. It still shows up as functioning. That tends to be the trend with most of the z-wave products. I have the same problem with the new 'smart vents' I purchased. They appear to be working fine, except they do not function when prompted by the app, and give no indication that you're just moving buttons in an app. Love the concept, execution needs work."

There is a known, acknowledged by Logitech problem with this model (and several others) in that it emits a relatively loud high-pitched whirring or buzzing noise anytime it is in use/motion. It's nauseating, unacceptable and a great example of Logitech's refusal to resolve elementary engineering problems. Logitech has a long history of poor noise control; I get the same loud noise on my DiNovo Edge keyboard when it's charging, and Logitech's wall wart power supplies do the same. Sure, Logitech has great customer support, but what's the use when -- in the end -- you'll just get a replacement with the same problem?

It has a microphone built in which allows hands-free calling

154131,0.0,"The outside of the box on PNY products says ""PNY Tachnologies offers a lifetime warranty."" Based on past experience, that means to me, my lifetime. Like Sears Craftsman tools. They offer a REAL lifetime warranty on their good tools. But that's not what PNY means. Once PNY has your money and you open the box, the first thing you get is a bright orange ""STOP READ THIS..."" note saying: ""...Lifetime is defined as the lifetime of the product on the market."" Meaning once the product is no longer manufactured, you're out of luck. And we all know how short the lifetime of computer products is.
Why don't they just print the truth on the box. I would know up front that the warranty is limited to the self life of the product. I wouldn't have any problem with that. It's the fact that they are blatently misleading about it.

1246353,0.0,"I have had a 659 remote for many years, thought is would be nice to upgrade, when I revamped my HT. The new system, included an HTPC and wanted to be able to control that as well. You would think, for $250.00 and clean indication, that the unit was billed as a HTPC control device, that it would have a mouse pad function, but not here. So it makes the unit useless, for HTPC control. Also, the unit has a major problem switching the inputs, on samsung displays because of how samsung TV's sequence between inputs, it never gets it right and you have to use the help, every time you switch. It never learns the proper switching function, because it does not know what state the samsung TV is in. Simply 2 inputs and it never gets it right. Crazy amounts of time, to program custom switching and control. It will do most of what you need, but it will take a lot of patients to get there. Just not worth the expense and time. The 659 I have, does everything this does and used the exact same software version for programming. The other frustrating issue you will find, is that every time you need to use the device, you have to look at it, because it has a very limited set of hard buttons. So, you are forced to have most functions setup on the touch screen, you can't find the functions, unless you look at it. This remote just looks good and that is about it."

With my built in modem on my laptop, I was getting about 30 Mb per second if I was lucky. my Internet service that I pay for is 450 Mb per second. by disabling my internal modem on my laptop and using this in the USB port, I was able to get up to 47 Mb per second. It is a true easy fix to anyone looking for a portable modem that you can carry anywhere and have the fastest speeds available per your routers specifications. Five stars all the way!"
6041529,1.0,"I installed this head unit in my Subaru a few months ago and I have loved it.  I have never really considered myself as an ""audiophile"", but I have been installing head units, speakers, and subs in my own vehicles as well as friends and family for years.  Last year when I purchased my Subaru I loved it right away, but I think when I turned on the stock radio a little piece of me died..... I started by upgrading the speakers in the car and added amps and a sub.  These changes helped quite a bit, but the void in my soul which was created by the stock receiver wasn't filled until I finished things off with this Kenwood.  This unit runs very smoothly from screen to screen, and looks very nice installed.  It took me a week or two to feel my way around the features and settings, but after that initial learning period I have become comfortable with it.  The sound is crystal clear and the equalizer and tuning features are great.  I love using Android Auto (I didn't think that I would), but I have also used the other connectivity options that head unit offers and have been happy with them as well.  The big display is awesome and helps make any of the on-screen selections easy!"

3118567,1.0,"Makes adding additional radiator fans or case fans a breeze. Comes with an awesome 3M velcro like adhesive pad, except there is no hook/loop...its the same pattern on both parts which makes it work so much better. It also is VERY secure.

Take note that the GLOSSY port is the only port that will read Fan RPM. This is how it has to be! Other fan controllers mess this up, but not Silverstone. If you mix multiple types of fans/sizes/etc you will not have accurate RPM readings on the others, but IMO that's totally fine.

It has an external sata power connection so that you won't overload your motherboards fan headers.

Hides easily and is not too thick where it won't sit on the backside of most motherboard trays. I've used these in multiple cases and have been able to hide them w/o issue.

And you can't beat the price!"

I hook it up to my phone through Bluetooth & my laptop too & it always comes in handy.

Since the Kindle is not backlit, I thought a clip on light would be nice for when I read in the car or when I didn't want to leave our bedroom light on when I was unable to put down my newest novel.  Enter the Mighty-Brite....it is flexible, light and clips on to my kindle cover.  It gives good coverage of light and is not too bright or too dim.  Just right in my opinion. I also have used it to clip on to a hardbound as well, and overall I felt this was a really good product.  Nice design, good light and good value in my opinion.

712149,1.0,"I hope the price stays low. Looks like it went up a little bit. I paid $12 just last week. This was bought for my 8gb Zune. It seems like others with certain Zune versions do not have 100% functionality.

It works great! Good quality product right down to the packaging. My remote also came dead. Just popped in a new battery and now it's working like a champ. The remote performs excellently. One thing I do not like was the radio does not work. Because obviously you cannot connect headphones in which the cord is used as an antenna. Well you can come up with a way to plug in a headphone but of course it is going to require some drilling or cutting of the base. Something I surely do not want to do!

The dock charges like it should and is also convenient instead of turning on your PC to charge. I love everything about this and it matches my Zune perfectly. It does not feel cheap at all.

Buy it NOW and don't forget to get some 2032 sized watch batteries. You can't say no for this price!"

With this little device I have a better chance of remotely controlling the phone and music on my iPhone.

The bluetooth connection is easy and you cannot use the headphone controls for any thing.  Everything is controlled by this little bluetooth wonder.  The only problem is it is small and I will in all likely hood misplace it.  The Jumbl is sturdy and well priced. Sound is perfect-I am using my favorite older set of wired bose earbuds."

2589427,1.0,"I spent quite some time searching for a good cover, and after using this for a week, I'm very happy that I chose this cover.

PROS:
Great quality
Corner protection (don't get a cover without it!)
The edge of the iPad gets seated securely when in picture or typing mode
Closing the cover puts the iPad to sleep, without exception
Easy access to buttons
Multiple viewing, holding, reading angles and options

CONS:
To prop the iPad into a viewing angle, you need to snap the upper and lower left corners out of their brackets.  It's very easy to do (and I wouldn't trade the corner protection), but it's not quite as easy as I had thougth it would be.

I have used this cover for a week, I would definately purchase it, if I had to do it over again."

In my case, three different computers (with Windows 7 & Windows Vista) failed to reformat it: I always got an error message at the end, after 12 hours of reformatting process (12 hours each time!).

Forgot, needed to add keyboard and mouse so I'm close to $750. I'm having buyers remorse and should have done my homework on the cost. Was going to return it, but since it's setup, I'll keep it.

The unit is good for low to mid processing work, graphics are adequate but not outstanding. If your looking for a small unit with a good processor and superior graphics, look at the Asus VM62 and save yourself $200. I have two and use one on a very large screen tv and I'm impressed with quality of display.

Update, ASUS has a nice app called WiFi-Go where you can control your ASUS computer with a iOS app, UN62 can't use it.

You are in I7 territory at $750"
148235,0.0,"I always thought you could trust SONY to make great products but this radio is a piece of junk. I bought it to use on my daily walks and it worked fairly well for the first 3 months. Then the LCD display went bonkers and no longer displays anything useful. Since you normally need to charge the battery from time to time it drove me crazy when all the preset stations become lost each time you remove the battery. I normally only listen to one station but it still is a pain to have to sync in a radio station from another radio in the house (much easier to do if the LCD display worked). Finally, the radio just went totally dead so now I use it as a fishing line sinker. All in all I got about 6 months use out of this radio before it found its true calling."

355357,0.0,I ordered this last week. I'll start off saying I've had a handful of detectors (all have been cobra). I thought I would try this as it had good reviews. I have had it for about 5 days now and the second night I had it I happened to drive past two car accidents where there were multiple police cars and emergency vehicles. I'm questioning this device because it didn't do anything as I drove past either accident. I know the vehicles have to have their radars on for the device to pick it up. I find it hard to believe that not one of those vehicles had its radar on as there were at least 3 police cars at each accident. The only time it ever goes off is when I'm in front of a grocery store from the auto doors setting it off. I'll be returning this and going back to Cobra detectors as I feel they actually work.

After investigating the cable I found that the HDMI end of the cable did not fit into my TV's HDMI port snugly and if the cable was not held up in the TV's connector no signal would come through. At first I thought it might be a bad HDMI port on my new TV. However, after trying this cable in all three of my HDMI ports and having the exact same issue, I then tested the Mediabridge cable I purchased from Amazon for my DVD player in all of the sockets and it worked perfectly. The other HDMI cables I have all fit snugly into the HDMI sockets on my TV. This cable feels like it's ready to fall out at any time no matter what socket it's put in.

1353584,1.0,"I bought this case for my ELPH 300 HS and it is perfect.  I am able to easily slide the camera in and out and don't have to mess with opening the zipper all the way across the case.  These cases are nice in that the zipper only runs from the 10 o'clock position to about the 5 o'clock position.  It makes it so much easier to open and close in a hurry.  As mentioned in a earlier review, the carabiner seems very tough and the stitching suffice.  It seems to be enough cushion to prevent any damage from routing drops and dings.

Very roomy for my ELPH.

In the case I have at least 2 spare batteries and at least two extra SD cards in cases.  I run my micro tripod through the carabiner when I am not using it and it keeps it there so I won't lose it.

1384997,1.0,"First off, these are speakers for your PC. They are not for an audiophile who complains that a 256kbps MP3 is not worthy of a listen. They are also not intended to be connected to a sound system that will deliver rich sound to an entire room. They will, however, deliver very nice sound to a typical desktop workspace.

As a set of multimedia speakers for listening to streaming music or to MP3s from your Mac or PC, they are a great choice. Their design is to direct the mid-level sound downward. The reflection of the sound is obviously important,  so the surface where the speakers live will matter. A typical hard desktop surface is perfect. I have the subwoofer on the floor underneath my desk and still find myself turning down the bass most of the time."
4558520,1.0,I almost avoided due to negative reviews.  Mine has plenty of magnetic grip while protecting the SCREEN.  It's not advertised as a case.  It's very slim and functional.  For travel purposes I use the GMYLE felt sleeve which accepts the Nexus with this cover on.  Very pleased.

The A30 is very close to my $500 BX-3's in top-tier optical performance (amazing), only lacking in weather proofing and super 3-D Depth-of-field!  The A30's sharp, crystal clear detailed images even bested some nice Steiner compacts ($175) and totally blew away these Bushnell Powerviews!

The other day I was shooting a video after a storm had passed and the winds were still hovering around 20mph.  Once I put on the 'Dead Wombat' the wind noise was literally cut down to nothing.  At first I thought it wasn't working because shotgun mic (NTG2) was picking up the leaves falling and I thought it was wind....it was just that clear!

The most important factor of this package is the DEAD WOMBAT (which is included and thank you RODE for doing that).  This is and will be the only thing you have to stop the wind and it works flawlessly.  You will need this in any high wind situation.

All in all, if you're looking for a wind muff, a high quality shotgun mic holder or  just a better (or the best) way to cut out the wind from your production, I cannot emphasize this next statement enough....BUY THIS."

4074008,0.0,"I have and am still using the Sony ICF-C218 I purchased 9 years ago. It is still a 5 star radio. The Sony ICFC1 'radio' fails on all levels; poor audio quality, very poor reception, and a noticeable ""HISS"" coming from the speaker when turned off. The Sony ICF-C218 'radio' has superb audio quality, great reception and NO ""HISS"" when turned off. Both of the clock radio's clocks have the same settings and features including Auto DST.

I returned the Sony ICFC1 and ordered a new Sony ICF-C218 at double the price ($39.95) from another Prime seller. Why? I prefer quality and performance over the way a radio ""looks"". Even though the Sony ICF-C218 is discontinued per the manufacturer it is still the top Sony Clock Radio performer and is available form many Sellers with Amazon Prime's Free 2-day shipping. The Sony ICF-C218 is a good clock and a great radio. The Sony ICFC1 is a good clock and a terrible radio.

The Sony ICFC1 was placed in the exact same location of the Sony ICF-C218 for my radio quality review.

It all depends whether you want to look at the radio or listen to the radio.

NOTE: This review has nothing to do with the Seller in any way. It has everything to do with the obvious degradation of Sony's radio design and quality standards.

2105182,1.0,"It performed exactly as I hoped.
Being honest, this is a digital audio cable... and all you can hope for is that it delivers solid performance.

I can not attest to it being great with 5.1 or 7.2 surround sound because I used it to feed the digital output from my bluray player and feed into a DAC (digital to analog converter) to make stereo sound for an outdoor movie experience (the HDMI went to the projector so I needed to get the sound out separately). In this capacity, it worked flawlessly. The sound signal appeared to be clean and pure, and I got great sound out of the speakers, which means that the components and cables in all phases went well. I bought this and another cable (a 3' from Monoprice - also has a review) in case 1 had an issue, but both worked beautifully.

I expect this cable to last a long time and it works great, but I'd have no problems buying this again should I need another digital audio coax cable."

5604239,1.0,"The Sennheiser HD 471G Headset offers great comfort for long listening sessions, superior sound quality, and easy to use controls for calls or audio listening.  If you are looking for great sound, you will find it in the 471G headset.

One thing that is always a priority for me other than sound quality is the comfort of the headset.  Whether used in many short listening sessions or for long sessions, you want a headset that is not that noticeable and does not cause any discomfort.  Not only do the Sennheiser HD 471G's provide great comfort, but they do a great job of blocking out surrounding noise.

The cord is a bit on the short side, but since it is swappable it's not a huge deal.  The controls are easy to use and can be felt physically without having to look at them.  The sound quality of most Sennheiser headsets are excellent, and the HD 471G's live up to the name.  There is a consistent, clear, and crisp tone with almost all audio.  The bass levels are deep, but not overpowering.

3125743,1.0,"A nice complement to my Dell Latitude E6430's 8GB of memory and Intel Core i7 processor.

Performs better than most conventional laptop hard drives, but probably not for the reason you think. Forget that 7200 RPM rotation speed - it does improve things a bit, but it's mostly marketing hype. Instead, look at the other specs, most notably the SATA III interface and cache size. The SATA III interface makes it possible to get data in and out of this drive faster than most of its competitors, which have SATA II interfaces. (Of course, this only helps if your laptop has a SATA III interface. If it doesn't, then throughput will be no better than what you'd get with a SATA II drive.) The other factor that really matters is that this drive has a 32MB cache. Most laptop hard drives have only an 8MB cache. The bigger cache improves performance, because more reads then come from the drive's cache memory and less work needs to be done by the mechanical parts of the drive.

Obviously, a bigger cache would be even better. If you can find a laptop hard drive with a 64MB cache, it will outperform this one. And that's also why the relatively now SSHD hybrid drives perform better still - they have what amounts to an 8GB cache. But I found the HGST Travelstar 7K1000 1TB drive at a price comparable to regular 1TB drives with SATA II interfaces and 8MB caches (and, yes, 5400 RPM rotation speeds), while those nicer drives were all significantly more expensive."

Unfortunately, this drive can only transfer data for about 90 seconds before it fails.

If you have files that are large (roughly 3 gigs or more) that require longer than 90 seconds to copy, you won't be able to get them on this drive.

5518161,0.0,"UPDATED REVIEW from 3 stars to 1 star  on 4/10/16.

So I had my first auto incident today with this. A car backed up into me. 20 seconds or so after the incident I stopped the dash cam (because I knew in the past that the dash cam might start recording over stuff on its own). A few minutes ago I arrived at home and right away plugged my microSD card into my computer to review the clip which I needed to submit as evidence. And wouldn't you know, it's not there!

I have instead 6 clips recorded on my microSD device - apparently all from random dates and times. I drive my car everyday and use this dash cam every day. But my 6 recordings were scattered over random days over the last 2 months (since I first purchased this) with no rhyme or reason. The worst part: I don't have a single clip from today!

So I heartily warn people NOT to buy this. Even if you luck out and get a camera who's hardware is working correctly, the software is so screwed up that that you can't set it to continuously record. Spend the premium cash to get a dash cam that works. Lesson learned for me!

I don't know if JacobsParts buys factory rejects or where they get their goods from, but this card turned out not to be standard thickness. When I went to put it into a slot, it was more than a bit tight. And when I realized it wouldn't go in all the way and tried to remove it, it literally pulled the connector off the motherboard.

I tried in several other slots to make sure it wasn't a problem with the motherboard. It was too tight to go into any of the remaining slots on my damaged motherboard. I then got a genuine Syba. It looks just like this, but it fit into all slots perfectly. I also noticed in other reviews that when people did have problems with Syba products, Syba responded directly to the reviewers.

UPDATE: Although JacobsParts claimed that they didn't respond to my return requests, which Amazon's system indicated were being submitted for approval, because they don't see those requests until a product is returned, they did respond to my third request when I pointed out that the product was not as pictured, even though it's an absolute requirement by Amazon that all products shipped be exactly as pictured. They did give me a refund for the defective card. But I'd still question the quality of the product."

3623940,1.0,"I'm posting the same review for the Black, Medium Tip because I bought one Black and one Blue refills each.

I have been ordering from amazon the original Livescribe ink refills since 2009.  Just now checked my order history and have ordered 9 or more so far.  But unfortunately, the quality has deteriorated over time.  Not sure if it's because these inks have dried sitting in the warehouse.  But for the ones I ordered in Nov 2013, each ink could not even give me 5 pages worth of smooth writing and the ink would come out intermittently.

Then I stumbled upon these generic ones.  Seeing the positive reviews and the Seller actually answered reviews / comments about the guarantee, and also the fact that they are only a little more than than original ones, I went ahead and ordered a Black ink refill and a Blue ink refill.

I couldn't be happier.  First I tried each ink when I got them to make sure each wrote smoothly.  Now I have just finished using the first Black ink refill and it gave me a total of 52 pages of writing on an A5 Notebook.

Yes, the other comments about the ink seems a bit ""loose"" is true but it doesn't bother me.  The ink come out smoothly and at the 52nd page of writing before the ink finally ran out, it was still writing as smoothly as the first page and the ink stroke is as dark and thick as the first stroke.

From now on, I'm sticking with these generic refills - who says generic is not as good as the name brands?"

When I try to take photos the camera won't focus or shoot unless I hold the button down really hard. Sometimes it won't respond.

1. PC's often don't recognize the drive. I have to take it apart, pull out the mSATA, put it back in, put it back together and then PC's recognize the drive for about a day. Then it all happens again.
2. During data transfers over a few GB's it fails every time and the transfer stops.
3. Runs really really hot.

1511591,1.0,"The TP-LINK TL-WN822N Wireless N300 High Gain USB Adapter, 300Mbps with Dual 3dBi external antennas works very well. The installation and set-up was flawless on both my older (and faster) Dell Pentium desktop running XP and my ultraportable netbook, Acer Aspire One 722 running windows 7 home premium.  The wireless router (TP-Link TL-WR841N) is located on the ground floor and the computers are in the basement approximately 50 feet away. The signal strength is excellent. I can use the (little laptop) netbook out over 200 feet in the front and back yard. I haven't tested for a maximum distance but it is working better than any other wireless USB adapters that I have tried using 802.11n.
My Acer netbook runs so slow accessing the internet that I thought I would use an external WiFi versus the internal one and see if my surfing experience got any better and it is much better. So if anyone out there hates their laptop or older slow desktop on the internet give the TL-WN822N or a similar external product a try...I think you will find this item a great product and a great deal."
1706050,0.0,"Update: Confirmed that this cable sometimes does not work as USB 3.0 cable, but as USB 2.0 cable. The slight premium you pay for for USB 3.0 cable is wasted. Get another brand. At least the couple cables I got does not work properly as USB 3.0 cable when used with well known brand external disk drive and flash drives.  Another brand I got from other internet store works well.
----

I compared this with regular usb 2.0 extension cable to test read/write speed of a USB 3.0 external hard drive when connected to a USB 3.0 port.  Conclusion: can't see much difference.  USB 3.0 cable gives me about 60-90MB/sec write speed, and USB 2.0 cable also gives me about 60-90MB/sec speed. Both are the same.

Furthermore, when I connect various USB 3.0 device to USB 3.0 port using this extension, sometimes the device is recognized as USB 2.0 device as a prompt box appears in my tray area that the device will work faster if connected to USB 3.0 port.

I'll test using bencharmark software to confirm, but something's fishy about this cable, at least the one I got."

Update;
Well , a year later and now the power plug fell inside the unit never to be seen again without ripping it open and re-soldering. A waste of time. So for me , after replacing defective power cord and now a plug failure, it was not worth the money to me as quality of build is below standard. Will give different brand a try."

On the first weekend, I shot for about 3 hours using my Black Magic Cinema Camera. This battery was mounted on a plate that kept my camera at 100%. When I came home and put the battery on the charger, it was back to full in minutes. The second weekend, I used it for even longer, perhaps 5 to 6 hours, and it only took a little longer to bring the battery back to a full charge. I like the battery checker, and I love the huge capacity and light weight."

I have tested the Dell Vostro 11, Surface 3 (not pro) and this little guy certainly defeats its competitors (both in price and performance). The device is very slim and it's lighter than both the Vostro and Surface 3. With 2GB of RAM you get enough for casual applications. It won't run advanced games or editing software but you are paying for a tablet most likely for mobile applications, sending emails, web surfing, etc. The keyboard works flawlessly and connects via bluetooth. It is really easy to attach and the tablet is really secure when attached. I have had absolutely no issues with this tablet and would recommend it to anyone seeking for a mobile tablet at a price below $400 which includes a keyboard."

Partly my fault for not researching before ordering but this was purchased to use as a wireless bridge for devices with slower than AC wireless built-in, so this doesnt meet my needs.

Not sure if I want to wait until Asus pushes out new firmware that may open up media bridge mode (doubtful), sell it, or flash it with opensource firmware (openwrt?) to get media bridge support.

Asus and me both fail on this one I guess."

5543218,1.0,"I have used and will continue to use Samsung PRO memory cards.  They have yet to let me down and their performance/$ is great.  Unlike other recent reviews, my card did match the right part #/model #.  I have the 64 GB card and there were no stickers on the packaging covering up the PN.  Running CrystalDiskMark (2 different versions) gave me some pretty respectable speeds.

I have yet to test the card in actual use because the phone hasn't arrive yet.  Planning on putting this in a Motorolla X Pure Edition for photo storage.  I'm sure this UHS-1 card will not have a problem keeping up with the 1080P video or picture taking my wife will use it for.  I recommend these cards to all my friends and co-workers.  Of the 30 or 40 people have purchased after my recommendation, not one person has had any problems that they've mentioned to me.  You can't go wrong with these little guys if you ask me.

I should add that these tests were done using a transcend usb 3.0 memory card reader. A lot of times you cards speed can be bottlenecked by the device that it is connected to. If you aren't getting speeds this fast, perhaps your card reader is the bottleneck."

 The Mp3 player is nice although I won't use it too much(only for pics and video space..)The PMP video/movie viewer just blows my mind..I tested it out with some converted DVD movies(picture and sound Quality were top notch)..I tested out the video mode at a party...The party was wild ,,the video was/is....something to be remembered...lol...This cam makes video better than the camcorder I bought 5 years ago(REALLY)...
U can't go wrong with this NV3 Gadget Cam..
It also reads text..I have a few short stories on this Gadget..Some Bible verses also....
 As usual,this was a Good purchase In tha Amazon...Samsung,,,Keep it up...."

If you want a case that turns off the screen when the cover is closed you will have to order from someone other than Amazon.  There are several other companies selling the  case on Amazon so I would check with them before placing an order.  If the case had shipped with the closure magnets installed I would give the case 5 stars instead of 2.

Update: I contacted Targus about the issue and they are sending me a new case, therefore I give the case 5 starts."

1 - I could not get the player to connect via my ethernet cable I searched the website and found that I needed the software update - (which can only be done wirelessly or downloading to a flash drive and then placed in the root files in hopes the WD player will recognize and automatically update)  I did this and could not get the firmware updated -

2nd issue - The player would not link to my iMac sharing folder.

Third issue there is a horrible delay in the time the remote button is pushed and the actions on the screen.  the only thing this player did great at was physically connecting a WD stand alone external hard drive with movies via the Usb to the player.

When charging  - the unit gets very hot (using an laser guided heat reading gun I measured a top temp of 169 degrees Fahrenheit). See pictures.  It appears there is a safety feature that turns the unit off when it gets around the 170 degree mark until it cools and then it will resume charging again (until it overheats). This cycle is repeated until the computer is charged. The problem with this is when it stops and restarts the charging sequence I believe it's depleting battery life.

1268166,1.0,"CASE LOGIC produce great products, with well thought out content that you appreciate, but you don't always know why. The key ""selling point"" is that this Laptop Bag can contain a laptop in such a way that it complies with TSA guidelines. There is no definite point that it complies with TSA Guidelines, in fact  the best you can say is that it makes things easier, especially with the way with the Laptop fits in on one side, and the bag unzips in to two sides ( like a suit bag) and this means you can take the Laptop quickly off the  inspection area, and move on.
 The Entire bag can take all sorts of laptop utilities, and these can be placed in the many pockets all over the bag. The notes on the sales cards say that a 15 or 16 inch can be placed in the very plush laptop area ( my description there; the place for the laptop is a very plush soft area which can take a 17 inch MAC Book Pro easily.
As is the case with case logic, the frills are all superb. The items all feel like Italian leather, and the zips are as slick and as efficient as you can hope to get for this price.
 I have never seen a better laptop case. This will be great for day to day use, and with the extra supply of pockets and easy way to unzip the entire bag, you can comply with any TSA request, or if you really want to, maybe even carry a portfolio in the centre of the bag if you are going across town.

6533265,0.0,"Total Garbage.

In spite of instructions completely in Mandarin (I think?) I am familiar with these units and have installed them before.  Luckily the wire terminals are labeled in English so if you know your MOBO pin layout hooking them up is easy-peasy.

USB 3.0 worked fine.  USB 2.0 works fine.  USB 2.0 & Card Reader utilize same USB wire terminal (they are both on the same hub, same wire operates them both).  SD reader will read card once but taking the card out (either by 'safe removal', 'eject', or even just pulling the card out) results in total loss of card reader functions until system reboots.

For troubleshooting purposes I plugged in (before rebooting - into USB 2.0, same hub) an external card reader.  Was able to read multiple cards just fine, able to 'eject' and 'safely remove' those cards without any hassle and proceed to read another SD card put into same slot on external reader.

From my troubleshooting it is obvious that the problem is on the printed circuit board, low quality.  STAY AWAY DO NOT BUY.

Seriously, if you're buying this it's because you want a permanent card reader on your machine - USB 3.0 & USB 2.0 are a dime a dozen easy add-ons.  This card reader is crap, thus the entire unit is worthless.  Bummer for me, I waited over a month to install it because I was busy and didn't want to tear down my PC and re-route all the cables in my old case.  Total waste of $26.

6137490,0.0,"I accidently destroyed my 600 and was looking to replace it until I found out that the map software is not transferable to a replacement.  At least thats what I thought I read in the e-mail support reply:

>>""I understand from your mail that, you can tranfer maps from one unit to another.""

>>""I would like to inform you that you cant able to transfer the maps from one unit to another its not possible.""

Uh, what?  First of all that message made little sense.  And second, it appears I paid over $300 for what is now useless software.

Some other problems with the unit itself is the outlandish non-standard USB connection to which the charge cable must connect, thereby making it impossible to charge a second battery outside the unit.  This charging scheme also causes needless wear on the nonstandard USB cable.

With a 2gb SD card inserted the unit was very slow to start up, and occasionally the unit locked up before it got to the main screen.

The menus could be laid out more intuitively.

Still, I was looking to replace the unit because I didn't consider these problems to be show stoppers because the unit does have a good combination of features. However the inability to transfer the software is what will make me  refuse to buy another Magellan."

I have it connected to a 50"" Pioneer Kuro. I have not tried any kind of gaming.

Update: This quit working after about a year. The manufacturer replaced it after I paid to ship it to them. I was able to get an RMA after a couple e-mails back and forth with their techs.
Update #2: after getting it back from the manufacturer it quit again a couple months later. Rather than waste more money shipping it back again I tossed it in the trash."

Simply put this device, without a monthly subscription, is useless.  The subscription rate is an unnecessarily high $13/month (all you get are the listings and the privilege of using the device).  If you choose to drop your subscription and then later desire to reactivate it that will cost you an additional $25.  I'm sick of the money pit subscriptions that companies force you to sign up for.

I have copied,  deleted and re-copied over a terabyte worth of data files and no problems.  On the newer Windows 8 PC's with USB 3.0,  I got about 50MBs speed which in my opinion for an external USB drive that is only getting its power from the USB connection I think is excellent.  The size is pretty small and yet it can hold 1.8TB of data.  The price I think is also great.  I remember buying a much bulkier 500gb Maxtor drive with a power cord for $350 not that long ago.

I purchased a 150GB version less than one year ago.  It died on me yesterday, taking along 5 years of digital photos and 20 GB of music.  Many of the files were located only in this HDD.  (yes, I SHOULD be using external HDD for backup purposes only, but of course, I didn't!)

I quoted several data recovery services.  The quotes ranged from $250 - $2500. ARRRRGH!!

A spoke with a co-workers who used to work for a hard drive manufacturer.  When I described the symptoms (The HDD indicator light is on, but it does not appear to spin up.  No ""clicking noise of death"") he suggested a few things before I invest the large sums of money with a data recovery service.

I opened the external case, disconnected the HDD from the interface PCB and the connectors and took the HDD out.  I opened my PC, connected the HDD to the power supply cable....and voila! the HDD started to spin.  The problem was with the stuff acomdata designed (it was the power supply.  The HDD is sourced from and OEM)  The whole thing took 10 minutes.

The HDD now resides in my PC's spare HDD slot.  Didn't need to install a new driver. The PC recognizes it as before.  No $$ invovled.  WOO HOO!

The moral of the story is...acomdata is not to be trusted (don't cheap out on HDD's!!)....and BACK UP YOUR DATA!"

The reason I don't want the zipper all the way around is the risk with carrying your laptop and the zipper failing and damaging your laptop.

On top of that, the handle is all messed up.  The seam should be under it and not on the side.  This looks like a reject or something and is quite uncomfortable to carry.  I am very disappointed with Tomtoc and expect better from their products."

All-in-all, I can't remember getting a better package for the price--definitely gets a 5-star rating!"

458342,1.0,"You will be bowled over by the detail, color, and brightness of this TV. After seeing in the store I knew it would be good, but at home it surpassed my expectations. We bought the rear projection because the plasma would have been too shiny for our brightly-lit Living Room. The matt screen is perfect, but it does not get direct sunlight on it except in the mornings, when we don't watch TV anyway.

The difference between 1080 and 760 is quite obvious. Details jump off the screen at 1080. We watch it from about 17' away but even at 8' the resolution is exceptional.

Needless to say, I would buy it again. If I had more space I'd get the even larger one, although 50"" is really plenty big."

The hard drive works fine when eventually put into a new enclosure.  I'm not sure if may only work with older or smaller capacity drive, but it definately does not work with my 1TB drive.  There's basically no description of the product specs and instruction of operation.  The price is cheap, so I won't even bother returning this thing.  I guess there is silverling somewhere."

I still like this radio better than the Logitech...  After using it for a while about my only complaint is that the color used for night time clock is blue and as far as I can tell there is no way to change this.

Sure, the phone says ""this device is not compatible"" but that's an Apple issue not this products. Every accessory I've bought for my phone that isn't an Apple product gives that message. Just hit ""NO"" end of problem! If that is too much of a hassle for you then don't buy it. Try to find something better, you won't! If your phone is in a case (like mine is) you do need to remove the adaptor. It charges my phone, calls and texts come through no problem. I now have a 3Gs and it works just as well. I would buy it again and I have told friends to buy one as well."

Otherwise the sound is great - the best I've heard in any earbuds."

4774072,0.0,Junk. It worked pretty well when it worked. The 20 minutes I had to spend getting it to work each time was a pain and after about the fifth time it wouldn't connect to my blue tooth headphones at all any more. There was also a very soft static noise that faded in and out when I used this device. The best use for this device in my opinion is to give it to someone with a short fuse that you don't like and then sit back and watch him pop his top.

3188961,1.0,I purchased this camera locally about three months ago and it has been an awesome tool for the hobby of photography. I belong to a camera club with about forty members and there are three Sony shooters [of course Canon and Nikon are the most popular]. I get questions about this camera and seasoned photographers commenting on the quality of some of my captures. I bought a Sigma 18-250 macro HSM for it and the combo works great. I also purchased a 50 mm Minolta 1.7 used for cheap and I can get some very nice flower images with it. The lens you attach to it is critical.  My only beef with this camera is that I cannot actuate remotely only by tether. There is an app that claims to be able to do so via android cell phone but I have yet to get it to work.  It works great indoors and out- I am happy. This was my third dslr so I am not completely without background for making the purchase decision. It fit my budget and delivered. Enough said.

3522210,0.0,"I thought for sure I would like this different type of cover for the kindle but I don't. It feels very flimsy in the hands when trying to fold it back.  When I looked at the picture of the origami with the Kindle HDX, it gave me the impression that the device slid into a ""black frame"" providing support all around the HDX. I thought that would provide some protection as well but its obvious that I didn't read the description completely.  The entire backing of the Origami is like a huge magnet and clings to the back of the HDX. So when opening and closing the front part of it, that is where it feels flimsy in my hands. I will be returning the Origami back to Amazon and have already ordered the Otterbox for protection. I have always used Otterbox for my IPhones and have been very pleased with their products. My Origami arrived sooner then the HDX. After my HDX arrived and actually had the device in my hands, I felt that better protection is warranted especially for the price we paid. In my opinion, HDX feels so fragile compared to my Ipads and previous Kindles. When the Otterbox comes in I will be posting a review on that as well."

Very vibrant coloring, even better than the photo in real life. Perfect length and very comfortable to wear around your neck for shoots, doesnt slide around and stays in place nicely without rubbing or itching your neck, very smooth. I fully intend to purchase in every color, I absolutely adore vintage feeling floral prints it definitely my thing and making your camera an extension of yourself is wonderful. I 100% recommend this as a purchase, it will not disappoint! I ordered late on a Sunday night and had it by 10am on Tuesday, thank you Prime!

I did receive mine very wrinkled, but I figured I could just iron them out. However, the material doesn't really feel quite like cloth. It feels more like paper. I decided after a couple of tries that was almost making the wrinkles worse so I'd just see how it does with the wrinkles in it. After I hung it up and changed some settings in OBS via chroma key, you can't see any of them. So, for the $15 I spent I am very happy with the result. If you're planning to stream, this works great. I literally just used 5 tacks to hold it to the ceiling and that was it. If you're wanting something to last longer and plan on walking over it, I don't know that it would last as long, but it works amazing for what I need it for."

691775,1.0,"I am a big fan of CANON CAMERAS and I am happy to add this one to my list.  I just upgraded from the Canon A640 and the A650IS delivers everything it says.  The ""IS"" is a great feature and the addition of the AQUARIUM mode is great.  I love shooting at zoos and aquariums and this camera is an unexpected pleasure to do that job.

I used to own the CANON DSLR REBEL XT and thought that I would only be able to get great zoo shots with this camera.  I am happy to report that the CANON A650IS can do the job just as well.  While I am not saying that it is as good as having a 300mm lens (which I also had) the shots that I got from a distance were remarkable.  And it is a lot easier to carry around with you then a DSLR.

I am going to add the telephoto and wide angle lenses to my collection and will report back to let you know how they work with the A650IS.

If you are on the fence about what kind of camera to get the CANON A650IS is the way to go.

You will love it!!!

3210054,0.0,"Very soon after I received the watch, two problems surfaced. First, the screen frequently became distorted, with horizontal lines running across it, making it difficult or impossible to read. Secondly, it began periodically un-pairing from my phone, which I would discover after hours of receiving no notifications. I could pair it up again, but this happened every two or three days and became quite annoying. I wrote to Pebble and they sent me a replacement very quickly, but it exhibited the same problems. I then asked if I could return both watches for a refund. No, they would not allow that. They instead informed me that they would keep sending me replacements until I got one that worked properly. I am not interested in playing watch roulette; my feeling is, two strikes and you're out. At this writing they haven't offered me any alternative. My conclusion is that it is simply a cheap watch which is not built to last (my watch, incidentally, was never dropped or abused in any way). I guess I'll have to buy a different brand next time."

This is so stupid, it defies explanation. Out of curiosity I googled this issue and found the following,

""The headphone jack [on Logitech LS-11] cuts off the speakers and amplifier. The headphone connection goes back to the sound card or audio source which then controls the output. This is normal operation in most speakers. The Z-5500 is about the only Logitech speaker system that still works through the amp in the system. ""

After installing the drivers I restarted my comp and all of the sudden it BSOD on me for the first time since I built it. So I restarted it 2X and got it to work. At this point I was a little nervous but continued on. I ran BF4 and 3dmark 2013/11/Vantage. To be honest my framerates were really no different in BF4 then they were with the gtx770. I was a little disappointed considering that the game and this card were almost meant to be. My scores on the 3dmark tests were actually lower with the 280x. Not a huge deal if you don't really care about benching. The biggest kicker for me was about 3hrs after the install my card started to get artifacts. First it was while playing video games, but then it got worse. I couldn't even surf the net without getting screen tears across my monitor. I tried to keep an open mind and not get sucked into the whole AMD vs Nvidia thing, but it's like when you go to a restaurant and have a bad experience you don't go back for a while but decide to chance it again and hope they have improved but for whatever reason your experience is bad once again, you pretty much never want to go back.

4279294,1.0,This bag is amazing! I was looking all over the place for a good laptop bag and I found one. I have tried several other brands besides Swiss gear and they only lasted a couple months. I am an IT tech and I need to carry a ton of stuff for the just in case factor. This bag allows me to do it with ease and the bag is very light and worth the money. The only big factor was the color I hate being like everyone else with just the black bag but the red differently sets this apart for myself anyways. I am going to purchase another one for a backup but I doubt I will need it.

I noticed with the Hoya, that very often, even in very bright sunlight, that my built in flash would pop up and the flash would go off. Obviously the filter was cutting off so much light to the camera that the sensor was triggering the flash. While it did happen once with the B+W filter, it was in a shady spot and was not as troublesome as the Hoya. The glass appeared to be very good and caused no aberrations in the pictures, at least nothing visible to the eye.

The Polarizing function was good, with a brilliant October sky and lots of brilliant orange trees. It really improved the colors of my shots. My Competition Orange Mustang looked great, too!

Another good feature in a lens this wide - there was no visible vignetting of the lens - the filter did not influence the outer edge of the photos. This lens costs nearly twice what the Hoya HD filter costs, but I think it is worth it if you are looking for the best pictures possible."

2072985,1.0,"This is my first Harman Kardon receiver, which I got as a second receiver. My primaries in the past have been Denon and Rotel. So I wanted to try something a little simpler.

This is a good looking receiver with a minimalist look that HK is known for. It has the right inputs, in fact a lot for its price: 4 HDMI, 6 RCA, 2 Optical, 1 Coaxial, and 1 Component. There is just one HDMI out, so multi zone entertainment may not be in the books. Good enough for a home theater though.

This receiver has enough power to drive just about any speakers. I tried it with two-way towers and a center and did just great. The sound is detailed and balanced. With movies, the Dolby HD and other formats found on BluRay work just fine. It met my bar for a home theater receiver.

4888465,0.0,"frustrating experience with the product - this is what comes to mind as I write this review. I really wanted to like this product as the reviews from most users are stellar. But for me this product has been nothing but unreliable wifi connections. I have a 2 year old D-link AC3200, and that router has been rock solid. However, my house has certain dead spots due to the location of where my router is located. Hoping to relief the Wifi dead zones, I bought this extender. I have been getting constant 'no internet connection' status on multiple devices randomly as we browse different websites and doing different activities. The extender also slows down the wifi speed of my AC3200. When I turn this device on after a power cycle, it will affect the D-Link router and causes connection problems.

Maybe there's a compatibility issue between this NETGEAR extender with D-Link AC3200, but I don't have the resource or time to experiment with a NETGEAR nighthawk router to find out. I need a product that just works without much tinkering (I have enough things to worry about in my life then to debug a network router extender problem).

Good luck with your purchase."
4542732,0.0,"What a sad device. I thought I could watch movies from VUDU in 1080 HD. Nope. Only SD is allowed. Wanted to use it to watch videos from my video camera. Nope. MKV files are not supported. I had high hopes for this machine, especially with the exceptional battery life. Alas, it is nothing more than a web-surfing, email retrieving, YouTube watching, music listening computer pad running an Android-like system. Why Android-like? It only accepts Chromebook apps and won't work with standard Google Play Store apps. What a disappointment.

However if you want a little computer for web-based emails and surfing the Internet, this is great for that. It also does full HD watching YouTube videos and the SD quality isn't horrible on VUDU if you just want to watch a movie on a portable device. I guess I just had higher expectations of the capabilities of this machine. For not much more, I could have bought a real computer and been happier, but for what it is, it's nice. Just do some research to know what you're getting - and NOT getting - before you buy."

What I especially love is that it is universal... you can mount several different tablets with all different sizes. So I know that if we get a different tablet down the road.. I won't have to worry about buying another mount. I also really like that the actual wrap that goes on the headrest isn't bulky or uncomfortable for anyone that rides in front. It's thin enough that you don't even notice it when you head is resting on it.

515336,0.0,"Unsurprisingly, with tweeter units this small, there isn't a whole lot of midrange in this setup. But even allowing for that, the frequency response is inexcusably bad. The high end is shrill and raspy and heavy emphasized, as if it is intended for users with a serious hearing deficiency. The woofer unit has an ugly boxy resonance maybe around 100 Hz, encouraging me to turn the bass down so that I don't have to hear it--at which point, of course, I have very little bass response at all.

Only by extreme use of a graphic equalizer can I obtain barely tolerable performance from these speakers. And I mean, barely. No matter how I adjust the high end, there's still the sense that there are spikes in the response curve.

I am a Bose fan. I bought their Acoustimass system when it first appeared, decades ago. I have Bose noise-cancelling headphones, which I love. But this system seems a triumph of styling over performance. The standard of finish is high, and those little speakers are soooo cute, but--well, they sound like crappy little speakers."
5710076,0.0,"If you think that with this being a Samsung ""Smart"" product it would work with the ST Hub you would be terribly wrong.  This is a Wifi only cam that requires its own ""smart"" app.  The app is a typical Samsung affair - written by a third party, with a clunky non-intuitive interface that is unnecessarily complicated with techno babble.  I am very comfortable around tech and love my gadgets and still find this somewhat confusing.  The worst part is that the camera is ALWAYS on and  the app provides zero ability to schedule on-off times.  It can respond to events (motion/sound) but it is not immediately obvious what good these are other than to produce an annoying popup on your phone (if you choose to enable them).  Call me paranoid, but the last thing I want is a constant stream of my living room going out to the net"

2816637,0.0,"I bought this to make my life easier. I figured, wouldn't it be great if I didn't have to pull out the SD card and put it into my laptop to check my photos? Unfortunately, this thing was of no help.

First set-up was finnicky and took a lot of steps. Their software is clunky to use, has lots of unnecessary options, and requires setup locally and in the cloud.

Then, I noticed that the camera wouldn't connect to my laptop reliably enough. This just made me pull my hair out, and half the time I just had to plug in my SD card to get the photos off.
The other half of the time, when it did connect, each photo would literally take upwards of 30 seconds to transfer. I noticed that if I had a hundred photos from a trip, I needed to sit around for 50 minutes with my camera on while this thing drank battery and slowly transfered each photo.

It also used way more battery in the camera (my camera lasted for about 30% less time) when shooting photos (and not transferring). Well, thanks to this, I usually had to reach for the charger way more (esp. when transferring all my photos after a trip), completely negating the wireless benefits."

6190492,0.0,"Don't buy into the hype. I first fell victim to a diana mini that failed 4 months to the day I purchased it. My next camera was a holga purchased at a lomography store that had a broken frozen shutter as soon I opened the packaging. My last purchase was an LC-A+ that lasted exactly 1 month. 1 month!! The camera feels sturdy, but I should have known that something was wrong when I read the book that comes with the camera and it mentioned ""adjusting the battery contacts with a knife"". The camera operates on 3 button cell batteries. If you press the shutter and DON'T see the little red shutter/battery light in the view finder you don't get a picture. The light meter red light on the right side of the finder functioned fine but the shutter/battery light kept cutting off randomly. Changing batteries and carefully adjusting the contacts did nothing. 10 rolls of film through this camera and 5 were either completely or partially unexposed.

The banana plugs are solidly built and have great fit and finish.  I don't agree with a previous review that you could potentially short circuit, that could happen even with any banana plug if you short them.  While I agree to some extent that the locking mechanism could have been better, possibly with some grooves, however, I did not have any major issues installing them snugly, you just have to splice them well and make sure you lock them in tightly.  They look and work extremely well.  I'm using these with the 12 gauge oxygen-free copper speaker wire from Monoprice.

1157744,1.0,"Finding the right DTV antenna is straightforward, as long as you follow a few easy steps:

1) Find out where your transmitters are.  I went to tvfool, typed in my address and it gave me the distance and compass location of my local towers.  Signal strength (based on how far you are the the station's transmit power) is color coded, green being the strongest.  All the channels I wanted were 'green'.

2) Assess your surroundings.  If you have direct line of sight to the towers, great.  If you have trees, buildings or other obstructions in the way, things can get sketchy.

3) Pick the right antenna.  Fortuantely Winegard's website color codes their antennas and the FV-30BB was 'green'.

After receiving the antenna I tried it indoors.  Got almost all stations but several had minor to heavy pixelation at times.  Seeing as I had a fireplace and trees in the way I can't fault the antenna.  After mounting on the roof with a clear line of sight to the towers, all the channels I expected were received with nearly 100% signal strength."

I especially enjoyed the ridiculous comments lecturing people how they should embrace the annoying alarms, I'm not a fan.  I don't need any other indicators that my power is out, trust me.

5578203,1.0,"The ""Winegard Flatwave Amped"" is remarkable ! .... I purchased it to use with my TV in case a Hurricane blows my rooftop antenna down. Like an AM/FM radio, over-the-air TV can be a vital link after a storm. I just did a comparison of the Winegard taped to a second floor window near my TV and my amplified ""fringe"" multi-element rooftop antenna that is up about 26-feet in the air. The Winegard did better than the rooftop on VHF (Channels 2-12) and UHF (16-69) except for Channel 2. I had expected the Winegard to get just a few channels. It got the same number of channels (about 40) as the rooftop. A lot of the result is due to the fact that my rooftop antenna pushes the signal through a long coax with lots of splitters and the Winegard was directly connected to the TV - but I never expected a 23-inch square antenna that was the thickness of a sheet of cardboard to work so remarkably well."

Sure, other cameras have a larger zoom, but how many pictures do you really take with your camera zoomed all the way in?  In my case, hardly ever.  I find a camera with a wide angle lens is far more useful to me, and the FX-35 has a nice wide 25mm lens.  I find that the pictures are as good as my newer and more expensive Lumix cameras such as my Lumix ZS3.  I actually prefer the pictures I have taken with the FX-35 to the pictures I have taken with the ZS3.  The FX-35 pictures are just somehow brighter looking.  I do have a Pentax K200D digital SLR that takes clearer pictures, but it is much larger, heavier, and a hassle to carry around with me.  Not to mention, far more expensive.  And unless you are blowing the pictures up very large, the difference in clarity is not even realized.  And what good is a camera that is so large that you don't even want to lug it around with you?  So for me, the FX-35 is the perfect combination.

For its small size, the FX-35 takes beautiful pictures and is easily taken along.

Eventually I put the old 3965 back into the puter an problems ceased and it has performed all day quite well at 54 mhz. I suspect it was a bad card but I wasn't willing to risk another and have returned it to Amazon ,they have great return services. Discovered That I really need to take the laptop apart more often and clean it so it wasn't a total waste of time. Also as I had to boot so many times I found out I could use some more ram so I ordered that from Amazon also!"
6545903,1.0,"I absolutely love this monitor! I got it yesterday and it looked like a shining new  set (for a refurbished unit)I have a Samsung 4K Smart TV and the  Yamakasi is actually sharper at least in the video format. Now I won't talk about the speakers because I only found out they were there when my external ones didn't come to life(now they do)Wow ,what a display! I know ,you want to hear about the stand,it is shaky but I think I have found  a hidden  solution. For this you have to look at the bottom at the two "" D Ring Hinged  Screws. These screws are somehow self-tapping and  the  head  slot is very narrow requiring a special tool for a full tightening,so I used a screw driver thru the D Ring as leverage  ,by doing so I was able to get another 4-5 turns. These extra turns have made the stand much ,much,much more stable and level. It is definitely  worth the effort .  About the missing Users Guide ,my take on that is that if you need  a Guide and  in English to set up a pc monitor  then you  shouldn't be writing reviews here  or  try to  reset your home fuse box. I'm a Senior Citizen with bad eye sight,  but I know a great monitor when I see one. What?Not giving five stars because of a little shake!"

A quick google search yielded some short instructions on how to fix this and I was off and running in 3 minutes flat.  Get this remote!

IDK about every other consumer, but when i'm told I'll get X amount of Y. I expect the entirety of Y to be the same.

A REAL antenna control lets you pick the rotation direction and tells you the actual position as it moves, such as changing the direction from Northeast to Southwest in one step.  This has a single button and no indication of position.  When the button is pushed, it rotates, yet the direction is random, and the position is unknown.  Using the signal strength feature on your TV doesn't help much, because they are slow to respond.  So there's no way to tell, unless you're looking at it or have a spotter to relay the position.

2891965,1.0,"I love the quality and speed of DSLR cameras, but grew weary of lugging around all the equipment and wanting to buy new lenses and accessories all the time. So I decided to try this camera and see how things went. Well, I've very happy. No it's not the same exact quality but still very good! And if you know what you are doing and can set aperture you can still get pretty great portrait shots with the blurred background. Also I can shoot in RAW with this camera and squeak out all the details necessary for great landscapes. One thing I'm particularly impressed with is the auto settings. The camera can analyze a scene and decide the best settings pretty quickly. Even when I took a picture of my toddler, the camera recognized the young child and did a burst of 3 images without me telling it to. I wish I set it to RAW in auto mode. Another minor thing that I love about it is the control dial on the back. Most cameras (even DSLR) have buttons and you have to press several times for control, but this dial is wonderful and makes getting around in the menu and settings and focal points a dream. To summarize, I am once again inspired to do photography! Thanks to this camera."

Edit,

The manufacturer contacted me offering me a refund. I thought they would offer the refund for the bad product while keeping it since the installation was very expensive.

1751505,0.0,"The display looks fine.  The PIP works fine.

My only real complaint is that the monitor auto switches to whatever active video feed is available.

More specifically, i have a media system hooked up to the VGA input and my wife's computer hooked up to the HDMI.  When she shuts down her system and the media system is still running, the monitor automatically switches the main (big display) from her system to the media system.  So when she turns her system back on, she has to dive into the monitor menu to switch the input back.  This happens even if the PIP or VGA input isn't being used.  I'd like to disable this auto-switching but there is no option.

I wished i had a different PIP capable monitor, but we'll just have to adjust the setting each time we turn on her computer.

-------Update-------------------

Now when the pc display turns off, the monitor seems to detect a signal it flashes blue, then goes black about every 7 seconds.  In order to avoid seeing this monitor go through this cycle over and over, we just got to manually turn off the monitor.

Upon reading an RFID chip, the ChaFon reader triggers a plain text output at the cursor. Simple as a USB keyboard. I haven't tried it with any specialized RFID software yet, but if the PnP is this simple I don't expect any problems when I do.

What I didn't expect was the snazzy little foam lined metal box. Very nice touch. Makers of low cost electronics would do well to take a hint from ChaFon and spruce up their packaging a bit. I probably won't carry the ChaFon reader around in its snazzy metal box because the reader seems pretty robust and I opt to save space in my computer bag whenever I can, but I would have loved if a box like this shipped with my large-ish Amazon-bought cheaptastic WiFi adapter and its even larger-ish detachable antenna, because that's a minor nightmare to tote around in a bag pocket. Just an idea if you're reading this, component and device manufacturers!

Anywho. For any casual RFID detection, I think this reader will fit the bill.

5427119,0.0,"Pros:

Its cheap, has a decent feature set for what you've paid.

Cons:

-ASrock technical support is completely non-existent, I opened a case with them over 6 months ago and never heard back.
-Even after Asrock attemped to add OC support to this board they botched the vcore settings and you cant set things like the VCCIO voltage. The vcore is then set by offsets. Really ASrock? Are you trying to protect your Pro4 board? We can't have a straight vcore setting? Don't expect to get anything above a modest overclock even on a K series processor.
-At this point ASrock has abandoned providing any updates or support for this board. I had issues with the audio drivers where they would just stop working in windows 10 and you would have to reinstall them. The audio driver is dated from almost 1 year ago at this point.

Other Thoughts:

I wish I would have spent the extra money and gone with something else. I'd avoid buying anything from ASrock at this point."
1370715,0.0,"Two primary disappointments with this enclosure:

1. It requires two USB ports for power;
2. It worked out of the box, but failed to be recognized by every computer to which it was connected one week later.

The manual that comes with the enclosure must depict an older version, where the drive mount slides from the rear once the rear screws are removed; on the one I received, the drive mount slid out the front.  The enclosure comes with four screws in a small ziplock bag, so two are spares since the mount only has two holes for mounting the drive from the bottom.

The enclosure is attractively packaged and looks great, so I am very disappointed that it failed to work more than once -- a fact I verified by removing the 2.5 inch SATA drive and installing it in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ME-601SD-SBK-Predictor-SATA-Hard-Drive-USB-2-0-Docking-Station-for-2-5-Inch-3-5-Inch-SATA-II-3G-with-S-M-A-R-T-Serial-ATA-HDD-Hot-Swap-ME-601SD-SBK/dp/B001LGBH0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ME-601SD-SBK Predictor SATA Hard Drive USB 2.0 Docking Station for 2.5 Inch & 3.5 Inch SATA II/3G with S.M.A.R.T.

5110475,1.0,"I bought these for my own use in my townhome and have to say they ROCK. I got 2 sets (4 indidivdual units) and placed them in my 2 level unit. I can now move from area to area and between floors and the sound either travels with me or is waiting for me when I hit that floor/area/. I will definitely by more of these and maybe different iunits so I can eventually pair them as stereo units. Right noew they are ""mono"" but play well with each other.
The sound quality is great, the mixer (equalizer) if you like treble versus bass is well done.
The app (software to an old fart like me) ties my music subscriptions in perfectly. I have Rhapsody, Amazon Music, and Spotify I pay for that can be tied into the search functions. They all play well together.
The music channels you can get over the internet include every single station on my FM dial and they play flawlessly. I start my day with NPR everyday and it goes from the bathroom. to bedroom, down to kitchen/living room."

The time is set automatically when you plug it in, except it never keeps accurate time.  It is sometime ""off"" by 10 to 15 minutes.

It also works well for Astrophotography. I've used it to shoot the Horsehead Nebula and once we get a non-moonlit night I'm going to use it to shoot the Milky Way. I've gotten the Milky Way with the kit lens but I have a feeling this lens is going to be way better.

The one and only thing I've noticed is that sometimes it hunts for Autofocus but I'm certain that's more me just getting used to the limitations of the lens pertaining to distance (too close to the subject).

In any case,  just order it, it's easily one of Canon's better lenses. I would suggest that you get the hood with it, I did and found out that it really helps with glare when the light source is too the side"

3066742,0.0,"My camera takes great pictures.  When I went to download the pictures and print them I was not even allowed to complete the process.  First of all if you want to really screw up some ones head with a software program just put everything in a hard to find area on the screen and don't do anything that is normal with other software, like putting a print prompt under file. Put it some ware where you have to go to the instructions to figure it out. Another thing you can do is not allow your program to print without opening a certain office program.  Then make sure there's a glitch that won't let it print anyway.  Then of course set up your program so that it is so user unfriendly that it takes 30 minutes to figure out how to crop a photo.  It took me 30 seconds to figure this out on Sony software. There are not enough bad words in the English language to explain what crap this Panasonic software is.  I just spent 2 hours trying to print one picture and after doing everything necessary was given a message that said system malfunction and the program shut down.

It is considerable because over time the will leave carbon deposits on the outlet connections and then that will have to be replaced. Both of the batteries are slightly larger than the original GoPro batteries and seem to get hotter after usage than the originals.  One of the batteries does not seem to last as long as the other. The maximum time on the other battery is about the same as the original GoPro battery. I have yet to try the car plug, but may not bother if returning this. Since the battery is already tight and expands and gets very hot, I am concerned it will damage the camera."

It came with absolutely zero instructions, just on it's own in a cellophane bag.

Some people mentioned putting the velcro strap around the lens first with a rubber gripping side down, then securing the hood to the strap, well mine had the velcro strap sewn on. It doesn't come off nor does it have a ""gripping"" side. Both sides are standard hook and loop velcro and slide right off the flash very easily.

It also blocks the auto-focus sensor on the flash so again, it may be ok for off camera but on camera it's no good."

The fact that it can run on a battery also comes in handy. And the free cloud storage is great to have.

If you've used the previous card, you will need to reinstall the software and have it recognize the new card.  It will add the new card to cards it recognizes, so you will always be able to use your original one as well.

Eye-Fi is one of the truly great innovations in photography that helps speed the process up and make things much easier.

3249220,1.0,"Bought this shortly after buying the Tamrac 5696, and seeing this in Walmart for $19. It is far more streamlined than the Tamrac case; particularly because it does not have a front pocket.  The zip lid also keeps gives it nice clean lines compared to the baggy lid on the Tamrac. The Tamrac does have slightly better padding, but not significant.

The internal component holds the FZ200 with its lens hood attached in the reversed storage position.  This leaves a some space to put papers and lens cloths in the slot pocket inside the main compartment. The battery charger for the camera fits nicely in one side pocket, which leaves the second side pocket and the lid pocket open for things like my iPad card reader, extra batteries, remote, and SD card reader.

Next you need to know there is a difference between the reported network link speed and actual throughput.

If you are right next to the device you may see a link speed of 1300 Mbps, but your actual throughput best case scenario will be 120Mbps to 150Mbps right after the device has been rebooted.

As you move further away to actual distance one would be at in a home for example these speed fall off sharply.

Also the longer it runs and I mean in the time frame of a single day the performance just goes in to the toilet.

I have purchase now every single consumer grade 11ac and up to the 1000 dollar enterprice Ruckus 11AC devices and in dismay I can tell you the technology just isn't there yet.

Yes with the Ruckus you get slightly faster speed than a quality N wifi adapter but so not worth the price.

This device is so not worth price.

Look for a good Dual band N speed.

11AC isn't there yet"

But by far this is the worst product that that I have ever brought from monster. This was worse than the cheap cable that the cable company uses. I upgraded my entire condo with this and started to get a horrible picture on the TV and my Internet became slow beyond anything. To make things worse, I started getting interference from the train and taxi cabs which made me beyond angry, It felt as if I had dial up Internet and living in the 80s again. I called and complained to the cable company, they came out checked everything and told me that it was the monster cables. I couldn't believe it... they changed out all of my monster cables and placed their cheap white cables and bang everything was better and running smooth as it should be... So maybe this cable is good if you don't live in a city, of maybe it's good if you're upgrading from old f - pins from the 70s, but this so called shielded cable is not good for someone who lives within a city that has horrible interference such as trains planes and automobiles.

We were excited to hear about the Roku4 with optical out, for use in our home theater. We jumped on the pre-order list and received our unit in late October. After using the unit for one day, we noticed that the cooling fan was excessively loud, after the unit had been sitting overnight at the home screen. We unplugged the unit, placed in in a different location, checked for updates, then contacted support for return of the unit under their 30-Day Guarantee. Support said this was a problem with early models and promised that a new unit would resolve issue with the excessive heat and loud fan. The replacement unit arrived this morning, and it too exhibits the same issues. A) Quality control is poor and we received two bad units in a row? B) The Roku4 has a design flaw, making it run hot causing the cooling fan to run at high rpm's, when just sitting idle at the home screen. If the later is the case, I cannot imagine how hot the unit will get running 4K content. We have asked Ruku support to provide RMA so we can return the Roku4 and replace it with a Roku3. Love the Roku3. Roku4, no dice."

4971065,1.0,Pretty great monitor and I've had all types for many different years.  I was concerned that the resolution might make for text that is too tiny to see but it is so sharp that it's not really an issue.  The color quality is really excellent.  I also have the Dell U2415 and this looks much better and sharper with better quality color.

3638703,0.0,"I've barely used this since purchasing it and 2 SD modules and 2 CF modules/readers. Went to use it today and (counting from the top) bays 2 and 4 are dead. It's not the modules... switching them around, all of them work in bay 1 and 3. But bays 2 and 4 are just plain dead. So I paid for the convenience of having four readers... and now have only two. Poor quality or design. I wouldn't recommend this as any kind of solution.

UPDATE: I contacted Lexar... these things supposedly have a 2-year warranty on them... so I set up a return/etc. I'll update later on how that goes, and whether they ding me for shipping, etc. But so far, so good.

UPDATE2: Three weeks have passed and nothing from Lexar. They had promised to send me an email within 10 minutes of our original chat. Nope. I went back on their online chat, and asked what was happening... they said they'd sent an email after our last contact. Nope they didn't. They sent me a new email... and guess who's stuck with shipping? The customer. And you have to wait 14-21 days for them to ship out a replacement. So there's 2 months out of my 24 month warranty, and I have to pay for shipping. I'm going back to my original assessment. This is not a solution as it's unreliable. And their warranty service leaves much to be desired."

For the price and the convenience of the short throw and its portability I think it's a great unit.

6097501,0.0,"This lens was DOA on D90 and new D750. No auto focus. Attached to a D90 and D750 immediately after verifying a Nikkor lens did work. I'm surprised with how many positive reviews there are of this product. I did not purchase through Amazon and am going through problems with return. (ebay) Wrote to B & H and they did not recommend I buy, suggesting to step up to the Nikon AF 1.8D. My guess is the Yongnuo has terrible QC and we are only seeing good reviews from the lens which worked, thus the glowing 5 star ratings. Caveat emptor. You can buy a Nikkor refurb for $99 and a new one for $131.

Update: Something appears dreadfully wrong. I counted the contact pins on the Yongnuo vs my other perfectly functioning lens. The functioning lens has 10 contact pins and the Yongnuo has only 8! Now I'm no camera repair guy but I have a hunch this lens is never going to work no matter what one does. With two less contact pins than another perfectly operational lens I'm unclear how anyone is having success. But I do know this, it does not work on a brand new D750 Nikon camera body. End of story."

841993,1.0,"I am far from an electronics expert, and I was looking for a way to convert many of my VHS tapes to DVDs. I decided to take advantage of this reasonably priced machine, and am very glad I did. Stick a DVD-R in the disc compartment, the VHS tape you want to dub in the tape compartment, and following the instructions, you have a DVD copy! One piece of advice - when you put the VHS tape to be dubbed in and it starts to play, the tracking will start automatically. Let it finish, as even the oldest of your tapes should then play perfectly. If you interrupt the automatic tracking by pushing stop or fast forwarding or rewinding, and then attempt to automatically fix the tracking, the results won't be nearly as good. I can't speak for the many advanced features on the machine but I can say for my simple purposes, it works wonderfully."

Turns out almost ALL of the hairs were this loose, and no matter what, I couldn't get the slightly longer hairs to disappear - apparently every time I attempt to clean my camera lens, loose hairs will come out. This is super annoying and I can't believe I paid this much money for a product that is of such poor quality (if the hairs were secure, the pen would have been fine!)."
